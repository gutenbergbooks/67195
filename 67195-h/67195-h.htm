<h1>THE POOR MAN</h1>

<h2 class="nobreak">KWAN-YIN, GODDESS OF MERCY</h2>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Temple of Kwan-Yin.</span> A wide altar occupies
the whole of the back of the stage; a long fringe
of strips of yellow brocade hangs from the ceiling
to within three feet of the floor at either end of the
altar. In the centre of the altar the seated figure
of the goddess is vaguely visible in the dimness;
only the face is definitely seen—a golden face; the
expression is passionless and aloof. A long table
about 12 inches lower than the altar stands in front
of it, right across the stage. On the table, before
the feet of Kwan-yin, is her carved tablet with her
names in golden characters on a red lacquer ground.
In front of the tablet is a large brass bowl full of
joss-sticks, the smoke of which wavers in the air and
occasionally obscures the face of Kwan-yin. There
are several plates of waxen-looking fruit and cakes
on the table and two horn lanterns; these are the
only light on the scene. On either side of Kwan-yin,
between the table and the altar, there is a pillar
with a gilded wooden dragon twisted round it, head<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
downward. To the left, forward, is a large barrel-shaped
drum slung on a carved blackwood stand.</p>

<p>Four priests and two acolytes are seen like
shadows before this palely lit background. One
acolyte to the right of the table beats a little hoarse
bell. This he does during the course of the whole
scene, in the following rhythm:—7—8—20—7—8—20.
He should reach the 105th beat at the end of
the second hymn to Kwan-yin. The other acolyte
stands by the drum and beats it softly at irregular
intervals. The acolytes are little boys in long blue
coats. The four priests stand at the table with their
faces toward Kwan-yin; their robes are pale pink
silk with a length of deeper apricot pink draped
about the shoulders.</p>

<p>The priests kneel and kow-tow to Kwan-yin.
The acolytes sing:</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Shall not Kwan-yin bear a sword?</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Kwan-yin is no warrior.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Kwan-yin bears no sword.</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Kwan-yin has no battle.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This is her banner—a new day, a forgetting hour.</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Kwan-yin lives remembering tears.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">At this point the smoke of the joss-sticks veils the
face of Kwan-yin. A woman’s voice sings:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Wherefore remember tears?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shall tears be dried by remembrance?</div>

</div>

<p class="noindent">This voice is apparently not heard by the priests
and acolytes.</p>

<p class="noindent">Second and third priests:</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Thou taker away of tears.</div>

<p class="noindent">The smoke quivers across Kwan-yin’s face again and
the same woman’s voice sings:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Wherefore remember pain?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is there a road of escape out of the unending wilderness of pain?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Can Kwan-yin find a way where there is no way?</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Still the voice is unheard by the worshippers.
Fourth priest sings, and while he sings the acolyte
beats the drum softly at quick irregular intervals:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Kwan-yin shall come, shall come,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Surely she shall come,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To bring content and a new day to the desolate,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To bring the touch of hands and the song of birds</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To those who walk terribly alone.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To part the russet earth and the fingers of the leaves in the spring</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That they may give up their treasure</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To those who faint for lack of such treasure.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To listen to the long complaining of the old and the unwanted.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To bring lover to lover across the world,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thrusting the stars aside and cleaving the seas and the mountains.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To hold up the high paths beneath the feet of travellers.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To keep the persuading roar of waters from the ears of the broken-hearted.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To bring a smile to the narrow lips of death,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To make beautiful the eyes of death.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The woman’s voice again sings, unheeded, from behind
the veil of smoke:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Wherefore plead with death?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who shall soften the terrible heart of death?</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">All, in urgent but slow unison:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Kwan-yin.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Kwan-yin.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Kwan-yin.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Kwan-yin.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The golden face of Kwan-yin above the altar
changes suddenly and terribly and becomes like a
mass of fear. The lanterns flare spasmodically.
The voice can now be identified as Kwan-yin’s, but
still the priests stand unhearing with their heads
bowed and still the passionless bell rings.</p>

<p class="noindent">Kwan-yin, in a screaming voice:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Ah, be still, be still....</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I am Kwan-yin.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I am Mercy.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mercy is defeated.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mercy, who battled not, is defeated.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She is a captive bound to the chariot of pain.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sorrow has set his foot upon her neck.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sin has mocked her.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Turn away thine eyes from Mercy,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Woo her no more.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Cry upon her no more.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">There is an abrupt moment of silence as the light
becomes dim again and Kwan-yin’s face is frozen
into serenity. Then the fourth priest sings:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">What then are Mercy’s gifts? The rose-red slopes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of hills ... the secret twisted hands of trees?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shall not the moon and the stars redeem lost hopes?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What fairer gifts shall Mercy bring than these?</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">For, in the end, when our beseeching clamor</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dies with our bells; when fear devours our words;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lo, she shall come and hold the night with glamor,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lo, she shall come and sow the dawn with birds.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Ah, thou irrelevant saviour, ah, thou bringer</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of treasure from the empty sky, ah, thou</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Be silent now? Shalt thou be silent now?</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The 105th beat of the bell is now reached and there
is a pause in the ringing.</p>

<p class="noindent">All:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">KWAN-YIN.</div>

<p class="noindent">The bell is rung slowly three times. Then there is
absolute silence. There is now a tenseness in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
attitudes of all the worshippers; they lean forward
and look with suspense into Kwan-yin’s quite impassive
golden face.</p>

<p class="noindent">The lights go out suddenly.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER ONE</h2>

</div>

<p>Edward R. Williams was not listening. He was
studying a tailor’s advertisement in the <cite>Saturday
Evening Post</cite> showing a group of high-colored, high-bosomed
young men discussing a dog whose skin
had obviously been bought from the same tailor as
the young men’s clothes. Edward Williams turned
to a story which showed how a good young clerk
served one millionaire by overreaching another and
in the end became a millionaire himself, thus winning
the affections of “the Right Girl.”</p>

<p>Edward Williams felt intelligent and contemptuous—a
rare feeling for him. “Makes one thank
God one’s English,” he thought and then, because
he was in the habit of refuting morbidly every statement
he himself made, he thought of certain guides
to British taste in periodical literature and his mind
fell sheepishly silent. He looked out of the window.</p>

<p>I do not know how many hills lift up the dramatic
city of San Francisco from the level of her sea and
her bay. To the precipitous shoulder of one of
these hills clung the house in which Edward sat. It
was night-time and the great California stars hung
out of a thick dark sky. Perhaps the stars gave the
waters of the bay and of the Golden Gate their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
luminous look, as if there were light set in the floor
of the world, a great light overlaid by fathoms of
dark vivid water. Lights were spread like a veil
over the hills on the near side of the bay and, on
the far side, the mountains stood ankle deep in stars.</p>

<p>The music began again in the room. Music to
Edward Williams had no connection with words or
rules or understanding. He could not have been at
all musical, for he never thought of saying: “You
know Scriabine is clean, my dear, clean like a
scrubbed olive,” or, “It has been wittily said that
Moussorgski is the spiritual son of Ouida and
Charlemagne,” or any of the things sounding rather
like that, that we expect to hear from musical people
as the Victrola falls silent. Edward Williams
was a person of no facts at all; probably he was the
only person in the world so afflicted, or at any rate
the only man. Music to him was always anticipation
even when it was over. Now, listening, he
thought vaguely, “If the treble echoes the bass the
way I hope it will, that will be too good to bear—indeed
it will be as good as I expected, and that, of
course, is impossible....” The treble did that
very thing and Edward was blind with delight for
several seconds; he breathed in pleasure; there was
a sense of actual contraction in the roots of his hair.</p>

<p>The music paled like a candle and went out, and
Edward said, “What was that?” for he was
anxious to pursue that pursuing theme again across
a world of scant opportunity. He would not have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
remembered the name even had he been told it, but
at any rate nobody heard him. In America this
often happened to Edward Williams.</p>

<p>A woman’s sharp voice said, “Well say listen,
what was that? It was a dandy piece.” And
Edward heard the man with a cocktail shaker between
his knees reply, “That was the song of the
twelve eagles after the emeralds of the South Sea
lost their fragrance.” Someone added, “They were
crushed the day the love-tinker died on a hill of violets
in Vienna.” Edward Williams was pleased with
this conversation, although, of course, he knew that
it had not taken place. He knew well that he was
more than half deaf and in many moods he welcomed
the insight that his infirmity gave him into
matters that did not exist. His two friends had
been telling each other facts that both knew and that
Edward did not wish to know. Neither would, of
course, dream of mentioning emeralds or hills of
violets except when it was really necessary and helpful
to do so. Edward did not care. He felt that
his mind’s eye had acquired one picture the more
without the trouble of acquiring a fact.</p>

<p>Some music that did not interest Edward began
and Edward thought, “I wish I were really musical,
but if I wear this grave half-shut expression everybody
will think I am very musical indeed.” Nobody
looked at him, but he persisted in his selected expression.</p>

<p>Miss Rhoda Romero’s pictures hung all round<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
the room. Of these Edward thought, “If I am
asked I will look at them in silence with a chin-down,
eye-up sort of look, as if the sun were in my eyes and
then say ‘A-ha’ once slowly. Then people will
think I know how good they are—if they are good.”
But he never had had a chance to do this, because
nobody had ever formally introduced him to the
pictures. Rhoda Romero never asked people what
they thought of her pictures. She thought she knew.
They were mostly studies of assorted fruits in magenta
and mustard-colour running violently down
steep slopes into the sea. They were all called still
life, curiously enough. Rhoda Romero also, I need
hardly say, wrote poetry. It was, of course, unrhymed
and so delicately scanned that often there
was not room in a line for a word unless it were
spelt in the newest American manner; the poems
were usually about dirt or disease, and were believed
in Chicago to have an international reputation.</p>

<p>Rhoda Romero herself was insolent, handsome,
and contented. Almost the only thing that she regretted
about herself was that she had a great deal
of money. Her grandfather, a Mexican forty-niner,
had been so wise as to buy land all round one of
those cities of California whose motto—“Watch us
Grow”—had not been an idle boast. Many of these
cities have so far clamored for an audience under
false pretenses, and now try to justify themselves
by hanging signboards—“Drive Slowly, Congested
Business District”—on every gum-tree in the vicinity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
of the lonely real-estate office. Rhoda Romero’s city
could have paved her studio with gold, and this, she
felt, was a blot upon an artist’s reputation. She
thought that an artist ought to be “Of the People”
and, though she had been to a very ladylike school
in Virginia and had later graduated from a still
more ladylike college in Pennsylvania, she used what
she called “the speech of the people” whenever she
remembered to do so. For much the same reason
she shared a flat with Mr. Avery Bird, a transformed
Russian Jew with high upward hair. They
had once married in a moment of inconsistency but
had since divorced each other in order that they
might live together with a quiet conscience.</p>

<p>Mrs. Melsie Stone Ponting, tired of music, had
suddenly started an argument about Art and Sex.
You could tell it was an argument because now and
then a little hole in the close-knit fabric of her voice
occurred which was presumably filled up by some
man’s voice. In the United States you become used
to hearing only women. Men speak guiltily in small
suffocated voices. Yet arguments often seem just
as spirited as though the opponent were audible.
Before each clause of Mrs. Ponting’s argument she
opened her mouth for several seconds very widely,
showing the whole of her tongue. Sometimes Mr.
Avery Bird rudely took advantage of this necessity
to give voice to an epigram of his own which nobody
could follow.</p>

<p>The argument provided cover for Miss Romero<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
to say to her friend, Mr. Banner Hope, who was
trying to make his empty cocktail glass look as conspicuously
wistful as possible:</p>

<p>“Say, listen, Banner, I want to talk to you about
You Know Whom. We’ll mention no names....”</p>

<p>Mr. Hope looked doubtfully at Edward Williams,
who was about ten feet away.</p>

<p>“He’s good and deaf,” said Miss Romero; “he
can’t hear.” And indeed, beyond a preliminary
impression that Rhoda had begun a dramatic but
elusive conversation about Steel Men in the Flames,
Edward Williams did not hear. His protesting ears
were filled with the voice of Mrs. Ponting.</p>

<p>“Well, say, listen, Banner, have you heard the
latest?” continued Miss Romero.</p>

<p>Mr. Hope would have liked to be known as the
wickedest man in San Francisco. He therefore could
not possibly admit in so many words that he did
not know the latest—(the latest sounds too wicked
to miss)—so he moved his head ambiguously with
a wise groan.</p>

<p>“Of course, I’d be the last to pick on anyone for
being Bolshevik,” said Miss Romero. “Bolshevism,
as I said to the ‘What is Liberty’ Association only
the other day, is the only encouraging sane reaction
to a crazy world. But, you know, Our Friend here
can’t approach even Bolshevism sanely....”</p>

<p>“He drinks,” said Mr. Hope thirstily.</p>

<p>“There was a most discouraging scene in Alcatraz
Prison last visitors’ day. He and I went together<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
to try and say a few encouraging words to Bisley,
the C. O. Edward wouldn’t speak to Bisley when
he got there—he said there were too many Christians
banked up around him; and surely there was
a considerable crowd of rather discouraging dames
telling Bisley that Christ was coming—he’s a religious
objector, classed as Lunatic, so he has to suffer
for his reputation. But I stayed in the group by
way of comic relief, and Edward went glooming
and snooping around. Next I saw of him he was
sitting interlocked with Smith, the man who got
twelve years for writing <cite>If Abraham Lincoln
Returned</cite>. Poor Smith had a nerve-storm, you
know, after he got beaten up in prison for the third
time; he spends most of his time in solitary now—so
discouraging. Anyway I looked around and
saw Smith and Edward fairly clamped together. I
forgot about them for a while until I heard a hell
of an uproar, and I told Bisley, Fur Goodness sake—where’s
that darned Britisher?—my dear, it surely
was a presentiment. For there was Edward crying—believe
me, Banner, crying—that kid’s got no
more poise than a snake’s got hips—all het up and
trying to pull the hair off the prison officer in charge
of the gate—one of the warders was holding both
his arms.”</p>

<p>“Why, why, why, what d’you know about that.
He was stoo-ed, I guess,” said Mr. Banner Hope,
profoundly; but his heart was not in the matter. He
began moving his empty glass about so as to catch<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
the light, hoping, with this bait, to catch in addition
his hostess’s eye.</p>

<p>“Stoo-ed, you said it. He was crazy drunk. My
dear, believe me, it took me down thirty dollars to
get them to O.K. that lad’s exit from the prison.
I told them how he was only a Britisher and had
gotten himself shell shocked in the service of the
Allies.”</p>

<p>“Did he so?” asked Mr. Hope with a certain sympathy,
for, before he had met Miss Romero, grown
a beard, and thrown in his lot with the ‘advance-guard
of a freer America,’ he too had risked his
life for his country in the course of a month in a
training camp in Texas. “Shellshock? What d’you
know about that?”</p>

<p>“Air-raids, my dear,” said Miss Romero intensely.
“Edward R. Williams survived three air-raids
in his home-city—London. I’ll say he’s no
stranger to War....”</p>

<p>Mr. Hope occasionally felt that he could make
a more genuinely wicked impression if he could
think of something to say. “What d’you know
about that?” he said, a little doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Well, say, listen, Banner,” continued Miss
Romero, becoming now aware of the empty cocktail
glass as her rival for his attention. “Although,
of course, personally I’m just crazy about Edward
Williams, what with one thing and another it looks
like it’s up to me to get busy moving him some
place else. I’ll say the Bay Cities’ll get discouraged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
with him soon. Avery and me are through with
him. I talked to him about him drinking so much
and it seemed he’d gotten around to thinking himself
an interesting rebellious kinda guy, but I’ll say
all his stunts look just maudlin to me; he most always
cries, and he always quits before he can put over
the interesting rebellious thing he wants to say.
Say listen Banner——”</p>

<p>Mr. Hope started to attention.</p>

<p>“I’m planning to send Edward Williams to
China.”</p>

<p>“China.... Why, why, why?...”</p>

<p>“No, but listen, Banner, do you remember Mr.
Leung—Leung Tok Ngo—who was so encouraging
about the future of American art in the Orient?
He said the Chinese just didn’t begin to appreciate
the occidental artistic ideals of today; the man in the
street in the Orient, he said, would gape at you if
you talked of Cezanne or Pizarro. Of course he
took back Benstead’s Portrait of a Naked Broker
to his home in Shanghai; but that’s only one, my
dear, to a population of four hundred million. Now
listen, Banner, I kinda think I’ll make a genuine
United States drummer out of this Britisher ... a
drummer of ideals, if you get me. Edward Williams
is so darn glum—he surely must be an idealist. No
real artist that I know has anything on Edward for
real bad manners, and bad manners always gets
the dilettante. I’m going to send Edward to China
with two or three dozen of those studies of mine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
that didn’t sell at the Rebel’s Show. Leung is in
Shanghai and can help him. I tell you I’m through
with him. The Orient’s gotter take its turn at him
now. I’ll give him expenses one way and commission,
and then I quit.... Not that, as I say, I’m
not just crazy about Edward Williams personally.”</p>

<p>She was very direct. She left Banner Hope and
approached Edward. He sat slackly on an arm-chair,
arms forward, palms up, as though asking
for something.</p>

<p>“Say, listen, Edward, what’s your opinion of my
pictures?”</p>

<p>This much too general opening left no room for
the convention of appreciation that the careful Edward
had prepared. After some thought he therefore
answered, “I think they’re very nice.”</p>

<p>Miss Romero shrieked, “Very nice! Oh, Edward,
you’re so discouragingly British.” She proceeded
to convey to him the politer aspects of his banishment
to China. The illusion of usefulness and a
certain silliness about the plan attracted Edward,
who would have refused an offer of solid travelling
employment with a fixed salary. Even before he
heard of the commission he said, “Right you are,
Rhoda. There’s nothing in the world to stop me
going whenever you say.”</p>

<p>Emily came in. She had made friends with Avery
Bird without introduction at an Italian eating-house.
Mr. Bird’s lively yet—if the truth must be told—quite
innocent friendships with women were part of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
the game he and Rhoda were playing. Rhoda offset
them by discussing passion with all the men who
came to the studio.</p>

<p>In picking up Emily Mr. Bird felt that he was
unusually well justified. She was, of course, English,
but, on the other hand, she was beautiful.</p>

<p>Emily had fierce, almost agonised, eyes under up-slanting
brows. She had brushed her dark hair
rather flatly to a smoothly wrought Chinese puzzle
at the back of her head and, in the middle of her
brow, her hair grew down to a little point which was
consistent with the fact that every line in her face
was rather keen and curious and very definite.</p>

<p>When Edward Williams saw Emily he thought
at once, “What a miracle,” and as his heart went to
his throat the cocktail that he was drinking met it,
so that he choked without reserve or dignity. When
he recovered he found with delight that he could
hear every word she said. But after his third cocktail
he could always hear well. He thought, “I wish
I had reminded Rhoda that I wish to be called
Reynald in future instead of Edward. Rhoda
always forgets the things I want. That girl would
surely look round at me if she heard somebody call
out Reynald.”</p>

<p>One of the guests had already asked Emily for a
summary of British opinion on the subject of British
atrocities in Ireland, Egypt and India. Emily said
“You may well ask, you may well ask ...” with
great energy. She was only three days old in Californian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
ways, but the newcomer in the Western
States becomes at once almost pathetically precocious.
Yet nothing—not even self-restraint—can
save him from reproach. Speech may be only silver
in America, but silence is not in currency at all.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed; yes, indeed....” said Emily, looking
round nervously. Her audience noticed with displeasure
that she had not yet said anything to suggest
that she disliked being British. To be satisfied
with an alien status implies—in the United States—criticism
of the Constitution or George Washington
or something. The word criticism is of course
synonymous with insult. Aliens have to be very
careful.</p>

<p>Everyone looked at Emily and looked forward to
telling anecdotes later about the superciliousness
of the British. But after all she had only just come
into the room. Mr. Bird felt that his triumph was
going wrong. “Emily is here as secretary to a very
eminent Englishman, travelling with his wife to study
conditions in the United States. You all know the
French philosopher Moriband de Morthomme on
the subject of totems and barbarians, and you’ll
agree with me that it applies here.”</p>

<p>That may not have been quite the name he mentioned.
It does not matter. Everyone in the room
was accustomed to not knowing what Avery Bird
was talking about.</p>

<p>“I am secretary to a saint,” said Emily. She was
rather vehement because she was afraid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span></p>

<p>“Indeed,” said Miss Romero with a characteristic
swing of her hair, which was like a frilled red ballet-skirt
round her head. “What an encouraging job.
What kind of saint? There are saints and saints.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Emily. “Mine is both.” She added
after a pause, “I don’t use the word in the ordinary
sense which would just mean—a man I am in love
with. I mean a real saint who works miracles.”</p>

<p>“Why, how interesting,” said Miss Romero.
“Tell me, is he recognised by the Authorities?”</p>

<p>“I believe they have definitely made his reservation
in the flaming chariot,” said Emily. “And—oh,
I do hope his cloak will fall on me.”</p>

<p>“A bit chilly ... flying....” Edward was suddenly
understood to murmur into his cocktail glass.</p>

<p>“Explain yourself, Edward,” said Rhoda Romero
maternally.</p>

<p>Edward had just finished his fourth cocktail on
an empty stomach. The blaze of Emily’s eyes
seemed like searchlights on his lips. “Ou, I
dunno....” he said, delighted, “I often used to
think ... Elijah must have regretted dropping his
coat like that.... Probably quite inadvertent....
Of course ... central heating in the machine and
all that.... Still....”</p>

<p>“Aeronauts say there’s nothing so warm as
leather,” said Mrs. Melsie Stone Ponting. “An old
beau of mine....”</p>

<p>But Emily still looked kindly at Edward. He had
rarely been so fortunate. Everything in the room<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
seemed to him to be brightly outlined and, though
his hearing and his wit seemed to him happily alert,
he could not remember from one moment to another
the subject of the remarks he heard. Mr. Banner
Hope was laughing almost continuously. His laughter
was like something running helplessly down a
slope, stumbling at every breath. Emily’s saint was
spoken of in the same breath as mushrooms. A
miracle in connection with mushrooms at once
seemed to Edward quite inevitable. Mushrooms
were not logical; in fact they were made by fairies.
Fairies were little saints.</p>

<p>“I mayn’t be able to say much,” thought Edward.
“But I do have beautiful thoughts.”</p>

<p>But it appeared that Emily was now talking about
ducks. How enchantingly confusing.</p>

<p>“It was caught in the break of the waves,” said
Emily. “We saw it crash on the sand and struggle.
They are, after a storm. So awful to have
your own world turn against you like that. Usen’t
you to have nightmares that your mother had turned
into a lion and bit you when you ran to her? I was
far behind, finding out how much alike the edges of
all seas are—if you pat the wet sand with your
bare foot at Clacton-on-Sea or at Monte Carlo or at
Bombay, it turns into a sort of trembling junket and
here it was the same in the wake of a Pacific roller.
Anyway when I caught up with Tam he was sitting
by a broken duck. He had made it a little pillow of
sand. He was holding its poor throbbing web in his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
hand. We waited till it died. You would never
have thought a duck’s beak could have assumed an
expression of such utter peace.”</p>

<p>“Say, listen,” said Mrs. Ponting, “are all these
tales true?”</p>

<p>“Not particularly,” replied Emily. She added
after a moment, “Well, to change the subject, what
do you think of the Haiti question, the negro question,
and the question of the Philippines?” There
was no immediate answer to her question, so she
went on rather hastily, “Well, well, fiction is much
more fun than truth, isn’t it? Atrocities are delicious
to make up. And everyone with a great enthusiasm
or a grievance lies. I met a negro called Erle Takka,
who said that United States Marines strip the houses
of Haitian widows and orphans and then, while they
starve, stand around and prick them with bayonets
to make them dance. Too frightful, don’t you
think, and too interesting, but—at least to a prosaic
European ear—hardly likely. Up to now not a single
deputation to Washington on the subject of Haiti
has crossed my lips. Perhaps all this is rather
superfluous....”</p>

<p>“It is rather,” said Rhoda.</p>

<p>“It is very,” said Mrs. Ponting. “I never heard
such talk. Haiti indeed.... Whoever heard of
atrocities in Haiti?”</p>

<p>Emily was standing now and, with a feeling of
desolation, Edward Williams watched her putting
on a hat rather like Napoleon’s. She was nervously<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
arranging her clothes. She felt that she had been
talking too much. She had a curious lapse into
humility and talked in a little frightened undertone
to herself. “I expect my hair needs tidying awfully
... it’s a tragedy that all lockets hang face downward
... my bag ... her name is Esther.”</p>

<p>It had been a silly party. Everybody felt that—even
Edward, though the party had left him a
changed man. No room could be anything but
dramatic to him after seven cocktails, but he realised
now that the party had been silly, and that a pillar
of thin air against a background of Rhoda’s pictures
was an inadequate substitute for Emily. For Emily
was gone. Edward reminded himself that he could
walk perfectly straight if he concentrated. He
reached Rhoda successfully.</p>

<p>“Must home,” he said first by mistake and then
concentrated again. “I must be going home. By
the way, I may change my mind about the Orient.
Too far. Too sudden. I’ll think it over.” His
own voice sounded to him very indefinite and he
seemed to himself to have been talking for a long
time without getting anything said. “I’ll tell you
what,” he added intensely, “I’ll think it over.”</p>

<p>One of the most fascinating results of seven Gin-Old-Fashioneds
is the disappearance of intervals
between events. Before Edward R. Williams had
time to think another thought, there he was looking
down a precipice of street at a deliciously small
Emily a hundred feet below. San Francisco streets<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
often nose-dive like this. The grass grows between
their cobblestones because nobody dares to use them
except pulley cars and persons with very strong
ankles. Emily was walking gingerly down. Beside
her, plucking protectively but ineffectually at her
sleeve, was Banner Hope.</p>

<p>Edward followed. If he should let himself run
nothing could save him from falling like a stone into
Chinatown and bouncing thence into the bay. He
concentrated sternly on the alpine formation of the
sidewalk, and when he reached Emily she was alone.</p>

<p>“Wez Bope gone?” asked Edward.</p>

<p>“His tram came first,” replied Emily. “I’m waiting
for a Ferry tram.”</p>

<p>“Tram,” triumphed Edward, who had been
long exiled among mere street-cars. “That’s the
stuff to give ’em.... Tram.... Do ’em good
by Gosh....”</p>

<p>There was no Ferry car in sight.</p>

<p>“Would-nibby fun,” remarked Edward, “if we
had supper at Jove Pinelli’s. Night yet young....”</p>

<p>Emily paused a minute. “Yes, would-nib,” she
agreed.</p>

<p>Emily, though born in Kensington, had no ladylike
instincts. And of course her mother had never
actually warned her not to go to unrefined Italian
dives late at night with young men fortified by
cocktails to the seventh degree.</p>

<p>When Edward, carefully following Emily, reached
a table in Jove Pinelli’s sanded room he sat down,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
put his elbows on the table and buried his face in
his hands.</p>

<p>“I’m too tired,” he said, concentrating no longer.
“You order supper.” He was so tired that every
channel in his brain felt sore. He thought, “I am
going to die soon. If I were in a book and my
present feelings were described, readers would say,
Our Hero is going to die quite soon.... It would
be luck to die in love.” He suffocated with some
regret his intense sympathy for himself. He looked
slackly about the room and thought, “At least it is
fun being so wicked. Our Hero drunk and in love
on the Barbary Coast.”</p>

<p>The room was meant for people who felt like this.
Most of its occupants were simple excellent “steady
beaux” from respectable homes showing their girls
“Life.” One young man, who no doubt had a good
mother in Oakland and hid no thought from her,
was singing to some friends a song which he and
they believed to be very daring. “Picked it up in
Paris,” he said, and so indeed he had—from the
Victrola in the Y. M. C. A. there. There were a
few moody artists giving supper to ladies, who,
though painted, looked disappointingly safe. The
walls of the room, however, were decorated with
scarlet devils and there were several screened grottos
representing, apparently, private cubicles in Hell.</p>

<p>Presently Edward found that he had roused himself
to say, “You know, Emily, I love you....”</p>

<p>“I know it,” said Emily sadly. “I know it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span></p>

<p>One of them would no doubt have said more, but
at that moment a matchbox hit Emily on the back
of her Napoleonic hat.</p>

<p>“Oh, hang it all,” said Emily, putting down her
fork and spoon. “Don’t let’s disappoint anyone.
Let’s save the Barbary Coast’s reputation.”</p>

<p>She picked up the matchbox. It was from a hotel
and bore the legend—A Room and a Bath for a
Dollar and a Half. “Did you see who threw it?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“The little cad with horn glasses who hasn’t
shaved.”</p>

<p>“Shall I show you what one does next?”</p>

<p>Edward grunted. Emily turned and smiled intensely
at the thrower of the matchbox. Edward
could not see the smile, but he noticed idly how prettily
her hair gathered itself together for the knot,
just above the nape of her neck. The thrower of
the matchbox, who had been sitting with two women
and three bottles, rose and came over to the table
of Emily and Edward. He brought one of the
bottles, but neither of the women. He said to
Edward, “Say, mister, may I have the pleasure of
speaking to your lady friend?”</p>

<p>Edward grunted.</p>

<p>“My name is Charlie,” said the visitor, sitting
down and hospitably filling first Emily’s glass and
then Edward’s from his bottle. “Are you located
in San Fran? My home-city’s Seattle.”</p>

<p>“Mine is London (Eng.),” replied Emily briskly.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
“I’m doing a stunt. Round the World on a Motor
Scooter.”</p>

<p>“Gee....” exclaimed Charlie. “An auto-scooter!
Mine’s a bum job—selling Bindloss’s Suspenders.
An auto-scooter round the world....
Holy Gee! And where does your husband climb
on?”</p>

<p>Emily interrupted herself. She had already begun
to answer the expected question—And how do you
like America?</p>

<p>“Not my husband, my advance agent,” she said.
“He doesn’t climb on anywhere. He runs behind.”</p>

<p>“Gee!” exclaimed Charlie. “Well, say, listen. I
belong to the Welcoming Committee of Seattle. I’ll
tell the world it’d be highly appreciated if you could
put Seattle someway on your skedule and say a few
words in the Wesleyan Hall. We don’t get too
many auto-scooter experts on this side; no ma-am,
believe me.”</p>

<p>“I’d be delighted,” replied Emily. “I’ll have to
go to Seattle to get to Alaska, won’t I? I did give
a lecture once before by mistake. I was going round
the world then on a Caterpillar Tractor—demonstrating
it, you know. I had a mechanic and a friend
on board. We passed sounds of shouting in a saloon
in Dryville, Mo. My friend went in to enquire the
reason and he came out presently with the chairman,
having by some mistake led him to understand
that we were each prepared to give a short address
to the meeting. I gave rather a clever word picture<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
of Piccadilly (Eng.) during an air-raid. It was
unfortunate that the English accent had never before
been heard in Dryville, Mo., so I believe the meeting
took my address for a farmyard imitation. My
friend, a Philadelphian, spoke lucidly on the Mating
of Canaries in Captivity. The mechanic was very
shy; when he was finally pulled from behind the
bar and placed on the platform he said nothing but
‘My God.’ Nobody thought to tell us until we were
leaving that the meeting was really supposed to be
about Seventeen Year Locusts.”</p>

<p>“Is that right?” asked Charlie with a confused
look on his face. “Say listen, ma’am. You’re not
married?”</p>

<p>“I know it,” said Emily plaintively. “I know
it.... My mother often points that out to me.
To my mother I am the prodigal daughter and the
fatted calf is getting absolutely apoplectic waiting
for me. But, personally, I love swine and they love
me. Did you ever think of the Prodigal Son from
the swine’s point of view? They missing him so
dreadfully and looking for him everywhere with
little whining grunts.... And him gone for ever.
No, as you say, I am not married. Engaged two or
three deep, if you like, but not married. Why?”</p>

<p>“Well, say, don’t you want to dance?”</p>

<p>While they danced Edward sat and felt relieved.
Always when he was alone he felt relieved. To have
no effort to make was blessed to him. If anyone
were with him he thought constantly, “I am surely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
doing something wrong.” His trust in himself was
always on the point of collapse. Now he thought,
“For the moment I need do nothing. No one can
blame me now for doing nothing. No one can laugh
at me now.”</p>

<p>He was smothering a suspicion that Emily talked
too much. Would Jimmy have said, “Good Lord,
the woman’s a bore?” Edward would not listen
to this thought.</p>

<p>Emily came back saying, “Well, so long, Charlie.
See you in Seattle.”</p>

<p>“You betcher,” replied Charlie. He kissed her
hand and returned to his naturally irritated ladies.</p>

<p>“Does that surprise you?” asked Emily.</p>

<p>Edward awoke from his moment of blasphemy.
“You are so very beautiful. It did not surprise me
that he came.”</p>

<p>“No. But did it surprise you that he went?”</p>

<p>“I suppose he saw how absolutely furious I was
getting.”</p>

<p>“No. He danced with me. I dance very badly.
I once broke a bone in my left foot and it doesn’t
steer very well. It’s an unromantic disability, to
dance badly....”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t seem so to me.”</p>

<p>Their supper was cold and tasteless now.</p>

<p>“I wish I could tell you how much I love you,
Emily.”</p>

<p>“You have, dear,” said Emily kindly. Her fierce
wide eyes were fixed upon him. They were deep set,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
and Edward looked with a feeling of terrifying
intimacy at the shadows about them and at the
diagonal prolonged dimple that led from the inner
corner of her eye to her cheek. He felt he could
see her thinking, “I have been rather brazen and
silly tonight. You mustn’t forgive me, you must
love me all the better for it....”</p>

<p>“I haven’t told you. I couldn’t. To say anything
that I could say would just make you think I
loved you—just like that—that I was just one of a
lot of lovers....”</p>

<p>“You don’t know me,” said Emily. “You only
know what I look like. You have heard almost
nothing but lies from me. I have only room for
one true thing in my life.”</p>

<p>“You must make room for me. When can I see
you again?”</p>

<p>“We are going to Yosemite on Thursday. Isn’t
it fun? Two Ford-loads of us. Tam and Lucy and
I and Avery and Miss Romero and Mrs. Ponting
and Banner Hope. Now I have to catch the last
Ferry.”</p>

<p>Emily was always much affected by the skins and
shapes of men and women. The last hour had been
made almost unbearable to her by the fact that
Edward had red spots all over his forehead and
chin. I think Edward would have killed himself
had he known this. As a rule he thought of those
spots whenever he found himself being looked at.
But tonight he was tremulously uplifted. He really<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
forgot that Emily could see him; he knew only that
he could see Emily. If he were in a book, he
thought, the spots would not be mentioned. If the
book were well written the reader would now be
saying, “Our hero is surely more in love than ever
man was before.”</p>

<p>He took her over to Berkeley on the Ferry. They
stood on the deck in the brilliant moonlight as the
boat ran out of her little cubicle under the bright
eye of the Ferry Tower. The funnels and masts
of other ships stuck out of similar cubicles all along
the edge of the city. The ships looked like tall coy
ladies in inadequate bathing tents. The moonlight
was most fiercely bright. It seemed that the hills,
disguised in sunlight all day, had at last unmasked.
A long light cloud followed the summits of the
hills so that the horizon looked like an enormous
breaking wave. The air was full of lights and
stars, but the water remained sombre except for a
white strip spun across the bay by the moon. The
noise of the water growling at the bows of the ferry
so slightly occupied the silence that the screams of
the trains on the Oakland side were clear to the ear.
Clear to the sight were the trains themselves, little
swift snakes of light pursuing one another about
the bay’s edge and out on to the distant piers.</p>

<p>Edward had long arranged to have a party next
evening. The preparations were very laborious
and dull, like those for almost all parties given by
shy and homeless young men in conscientious return
for accumulated hospitalities. Everybody in
Edward’s circle had been invited such a long time
ago that no excuses had been possible. Had Edward
not reminded his friends constantly of the impending
event they would by now have forgotten all about it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span></p>

<p>In the morning at two o’clock Edward woke and
realised with a sickening explosion of the mind that
his party was certain to be an absolute and ridiculous
failure. “Me, a host to twenty people? I can’t
even take the responsibility of being a good
guest....” He had made a great resolve. “I will
invite Emily.”</p>

<p>He hoped that he would die before the party.
As a solver of problems it is a fact that death has
been over-rated. Edward miserably survived. He
had spent three dollars out of his last few score on
a room in a hotel in one of the eastern bay cities.
He had missed the last Ferry home the night before.
He took an unreasonably early Ferry back to San
Francisco.</p>

<p>California mornings are very happy even if you
are not in love. They fill you with happiness even
if you have been drinking too much the night before.
Tamalpais, San Francisco’s mountain, bore the sun
full in her face. Her shoulders were wrapped in a
rising cloud, her mantle was rose-gold and green
and, in the folds of her mantle, she boasted a steel
embroidery of redwoods. The mists about the
eastern hills were loosed and were blowing towards
the sea. The climbing suburb of Berkeley stood
clear, flushed with gardens. A glaze of golden
poppies lay on the slopes behind Berkeley. The
scrub-oaks grew, close as shadows, in the little
canyons. There was the rare gold-green of willows
against cloud-colored masses of eucalyptus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span></p>

<p>Californians have brought suburb-making almost
to an art. Their cities and their country-side are
equally suburban. No-one has a country house in
California; no-one has a city house. It is good to
see trees always from city windows, but it is not so
good always to see houses from country windows.
This, however, for better or worse, seems to be
California’s ideal, and she will not rest till she has
finished the task of turning herself into one long and
lovely Lower Tooting.</p>

<p>Edward stepped from the Ferry into the shrill
bell-like clamor of newspaper boys. He was always
outrun on arriving in San Francisco by the hard-shouldered
and agile business men who efficiently
caught trams on the instant of disembarking from
the Ferry. Edward ran among the women and the
aged and he thought, “Half of me is very nearly
happy this morning. Whatever the party’s like,
Emily must be made to come to it. The half of me
that thinks of seeing her is happy. The half that
thinks of her seeing me is miserable. People are
probably looking at me and saying, ‘There goes a
man in love.’”</p>

<p>All the women’s stores on Geary Street were
showing clothes that would have looked exquisite
on Emily.</p>

<p>Edward left the tame urban street-car and
mounted one of the wild open pulley-cars that soar
up precipices to the crags where artists and Italian
delicatessen merchants build their nests.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<p>Miss Romero, in a kimono perhaps expressive of
her soul, was preparing breakfast at an electric stove
in the studio. Mr. Bird, in another kimono which
showed a battle of sparrows on his spine, was washing
last night’s glasses at the sink. Their cat lay
on its side pressing its shoulder blades against the
sleeping Victrola. It was a parasite of a cat; it
prided itself on being a member of an ancient
civilisation. It never moved except to move away.
It had never seen a mouse fired in anger.</p>

<p>“I want to ask you three questions, Rhoda,” said
Edward, who was not slow to notice that Miss
Romero, after greeting him with automatic cordiality,
managed to suggest irritation by the set of
her shoulders as she bent over four nearly fried
eggs.</p>

<p>“Surely, Edward,” agreed Miss Romero. “I’m
good and busy, but go right ahead. Put your questions
snappily, though, A, B, and C.”</p>

<p>“A,” said Edward obediently, “I want to come
with you to Yosemite. In fact, Rhoda, please, I
must come with you to Yosemite.”</p>

<p>“Dear Edward, why can’t you go when and
where you’re wanted? Why do you have to do
things so damned intensely and unlike other folks?”</p>

<p>“I’m never wanted.”</p>

<p>“Shucks.”</p>

<p>“The Britisher,” said Mr. Bird, “always has to
try and act unlike other folks—that’s the only way
he can remind us crude Colonials of his superiority.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
The Britisher is like a bull moose in carpet slippers
sneezing at a poppy——”</p>

<p>“The American,” said Edward, mildly aroused,
“takes a good deal of trouble to be eccentric too.
Look at all these Cults and what not.... As a
Britisher I should say that eccentric Britishers are
fantastic; eccentric Americans are grotesque....”</p>

<p>“Well, for goodness’ sake, Edward Williams,”
exclaimed Rhoda, “what’s eating you? You didn’t
invent that dope. You stole it some place. Who’s
been injecting aphorisms into you?”</p>

<p>“Emily,” replied Edward honestly. “She said it
on the Ferry.”</p>

<p>This suggestion of criticism by two aliens at once
caught Mr. Bird’s attention. “The Britisher,” he
said, “is the most complacent creature on God’s
earth——”</p>

<p>“Poor thing,” interrupted Rhoda, who, having
been born in the United States, was not obliged to
be so ecstatically American as was Mr. Bird, who
originally came from Odessa. “In the presence of
God’s own countrymen he just has to keep his end
up some way. Do you like your fried eggs straight
up or turned, British biped? Well, pass on to B.”</p>

<p>“B,” said Edward. “Will you let me off going to
China?”</p>

<p>“But it’s all fixed up,” replied Rhoda. “And
Melsie Stone Ponting wants you to take her kiddie
across to his father in Shanghai. The father was
awarded custody in the courts, but somehow she’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
never gotten around to sending the boy. He’s so
full of pep she thinks he’ll fall into the ocean or get
knitted up with the engine the first day out.”</p>

<p>“I can’t go,” said Edward. “I’ve got a job.”</p>

<p>“You got a job between twelve and seven A. M.?”
exclaimed Rhoda. “Well, say, listen, aren’t you the
bright lad? What captain of industry have you
picked up with in the small hours?”</p>

<p>“He’s picked up with Emily,” said Mr. Bird.
Whenever he made a statement you could see him
trying to think of something smart and incomprehensible
to add to it. But this time he was interrupted.</p>

<p>“Now see here, Edward Williams,” said Miss
Romero. “You can take it from me right now that
there isn’t a scrap of use in your starting to rush
Emily. Look at Emily.... Look at you....
Aw, shucks, Edward, you surely are—discouraging.”</p>

<p>“I notice that myself,” admitted Edward, burying
his face in his hands.</p>

<p>During the depressed silence that followed, Miss
Romero swept on to a divan some bananas which
had been posing as still life on the table and arranged
instead a more formal group of fried eggs and hot
biscuits. They were half-way through breakfast
before she said, in the voice of one starting a new
subject, “Well, say, listen, Edward, don’t you want
to come with Avery and Melsie Ponting and Banner
Hope and me to Yosemite tomorrow? I’m just<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
crazy to know what your reaction is to some of our
National Parks.”</p>

<p>“I do want to,” said Edward.</p>

<p>“Melsie Ponting wants to have a talk with you
about taking her little boy to the Orient, so that’ll
suit her fine.”</p>

<p>“Emily,” added Avery Bird, “is going with
another party to another place.”</p>

<p>Rhoda Romero was a merciful woman and, though
Edward’s face was so tragic as to be ridiculous, she
said, “Emily will meet us at Yosemite.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t treated us to C yet,” said Mr. Bird,
going towards the door to show how entirely devoid
of interest he expected C to be. Avery disliked most
people, but he detested Edward. The view of Mr.
Bird with which poor Edward was most familiar
was that of his back as he sauntered away into
another room. Whenever Edward noticed this he
reminded himself morbidly of his own unpopularity,
but apart from this he much preferred Mr.
Bird’s absence to his savage tongue.</p>

<p>“Come out with me, Rhoda,” said Edward, “to
one of those little beaches.... I am so excited
... and unhappy. You are the only person in the
world crazy enough to be good to me.”</p>

<p>The little beaches line the southern shore of the
Golden Gate. Great rocks—dragon’s teeth—are
sown in the sand there, and these, turned into warriors,
fight the storms. The sea beats against them
and the sound of it is sometimes like whips and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
sometimes like guns. Now a rock stood between
Edward and the sea. Each wave as it struck the
rock threw up a fist of spray which opened quietly
like a hand in the air.</p>

<p>“This party,” began Edward. “Rhoda, I adore
Emily. I want Emily to come to my party and see
me at the top of my hour. And yet how shall I
make it my hour? Rhoda, Rhoda, can’t you save
me? What kind of an hour can I have?”</p>

<p>“Why, Edward,” exclaimed Rhoda. “Believe me,
folks are just the simplest animals in the world.
Nobody despises anyone without he despises himself,
and nobody despises a host who pays for good
unpretentious eats and drinks at any amusing dive.
Why don’t you think out some cute little notion to
surprise us all. You’ve no idea how easy us folks
are to amuse.”</p>

<p>Edward retired into the shadows of his agonised
soul. He tried to imagine himself introducing a
cute little notion with a light roguish gesture. “Now,
folks, guess what’s going to happen next....”
Could such words be uttered in Edward’s husky
and heavy voice? And then what would happen?
Something would try to happen and fail. Edward
turned simultaneously hot and cold as he imagined
the scene. Avery would say something about British
humor. Rhoda would be noisy and helpful. Melsie
Ponting would pretend to faint on the nearest man’s
shoulder. And Emily——</p>

<p>“For I must invite Emily,” he said aloud. “I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
won’t have a party without Emily. Please, Rhoda,
help me in this matter of Emily. Nobody helps me.
You don’t know how terrible it is being me. It
seems as if everyone were against me and as if I
mattered to nobody. Yet I matter so dreadfully to
myself. If you could——”</p>

<p>“Aw shucks, Edward,” said Rhoda, not unkindly.
“What’s eating you? It seems like everything’s got
to be agony to you. Agony’s your hobby, from the
way you act; and you’re welcome to it, for me. But
you don’t stop at that, you got to tell everybody how
it is. Don’t we all feel blue now and then without
having to act a hundred and fifty per cent intense
about it? If you get any kick out of feeling that
way about Emily, go ahead, go right on feeling it.
But have a heart and let up on agony for a
while.”</p>

<p>“Nobody’s on my side.... Nobody’s on my
side....” said Edward, standing up and clenching
his fists in half-conscious imitation of Emily’s vehement
manner. “I’m not pretending, Rhoda; it is
that I really do feel things a hundred and fifty per
cent intense. Be gentle with me....”</p>

<p>“Gentle is my middle name,” said Rhoda, and she
stood up and pressed a hand on each of his shoulders.
“What do you want me to do, you pity-beggar?”</p>

<p>“Can’t you see how it is with me?” said Edward.
“I’m not stupid. I’m not even slow, though I’m
deaf. If I’m alert and confident I’m not even very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
deaf. But God is against me, and you are all against
me, and nothing I do or say can ever be successful
because there is nobody on my side to lead the
applause. If I could even once come into a room
and have people look up and say ‘Hurrah, here he
is at last ...’ I’d be a different man. I’ve never
heard that. I hardly dare to be alive against so
much opposition. My own voice is terrible to me
because there is no-one who wants to hear it. I am
living on a giddy high peak of unhappiness. Once
before I have been a little bit in love. To my first
love I never spoke—without being interrupted by
Jimmy saying something far more interesting. Or
if I did speak she never listened. For she was one
of Jimmy’s loves—and he had a dozen others in
three years. I should think thirty women cried
when he was killed.... If things didn’t matter to
me so—I could have anything in the world I wanted.
Rhoda, if I could be sure of myself for one minute—it
would be worth while to be alive....”</p>

<p>As he said this, Edward saw the inner side of a
long cylinder wave as it broke on a clear stretch of
sand. It was the color of bright jade. The nearest
wave was jade-green, and the wave behind it was a
dull gold, and the wave behind that was a thick
violet, and behind that ran waves of endless shades
of blue. And behind all the waves stood the rust-red
and amethyst hills.</p>

<p>“Worth while to be alive?” thought Edward.
“What am I saying? I who can see so clearly....<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
Eyes in the world must always be happy, whatever
hearts may be....”</p>

<p>His mind considered itself for a moment almost
complacently. “In a way I must be rather an
interesting feller. Lots of fellers get no kick at
all out of impersonal things like colors and what
not. I really get a certain kick out of being so
unhappy. It is like being drunk, it makes one see
more faerily....”</p>

<p>He looked at Rhoda again. She was smoking,
leaning against a rock and drawing with a stick on
the sand. Rhoda’s strong short hair never blew
out of order. The tip of her nose was never shiny.
Nothing undignified ever dared to happen to
Rhoda.</p>

<p>He donned again his extravagantly appealing
look. “Rhoda, if you could let me have an hour of
my own. I have never had an hour of my own.
Think of all the hours you have possessed—and
spare me one. Let me take command to-night, let
everybody see me in command ... let Emily see
me....”</p>

<p>“Me—me ...” he thought. “What kind of a
Me would Emily want to see?... There isn’t
any cute little notion that would delight Emily....
She would be terribly stabbing and cold to a cute
little notion....”</p>

<p>“Yet I will ride that hour,” he told himself in the
street-car. “It must be my hour....”</p>

<p>These were poor Edward’s accomplishments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<p>He could do two card tricks, but anyone smart
could see through them.</p>

<p>He could sing in an unresonant voice a few of the
old sea-chanteys with which Jimmy used to inspire
delighted applause.</p>

<p>He could make paper crabs. That was rather a
cute notion. But not cute enough to be the life and
soul of a party. The crabs would do as a side-line.
This thought enlivened his wits a little.</p>

<p>He could write poetry. It was unhappy, offended
poetry, but not always very bad. He himself recited
it at night to himself and thought it good, but he
was sure that nobody else in the world would understand
it.</p>

<p>Edward had no capacity for being comfortable.
He lived in a small room in a cheap hotel in San
Francisco, and in that room there was no trace of
Edward except Edward himself. The room was
allowed to remain an undisguised hotel room. A
defaced card of advertisements and hotel regulations
was on the door, a green pottery spittoon on
the floor, a gaudy but not clean cotton padded quilt
on the bed. Even the dirty jokes which some predecessor
had written on the wall were left, and on
the dressing-table was the Gideon Society’s Bible,
the flyleaf of which gave lists of texts to look up
when business was bad or after making a successful
deal.</p>

<p>In this heartless room Edward lived, with a telephone
for his only companion. In this room that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
day he sat on the small stiff armless rocking-chair
until he had made a resolve and then he spent thirty-five
minutes at the telephone.</p>

<p>Nearly everybody in San Francisco writes poetry.
Few San Franciscans would admit this, but most of
them would rather like to have their productions
accidentally discovered.</p>

<p>There was quite a decided rise in the stock of
Edward’s party after he had telephoned his confused
instructions to his guests. Edward imagined all his
guests smiling tolerantly at their own folly and his.
They would hunt in the pigeon-holes of their bureaux
and bring out secret typescript. “Such nonsense,”
they would say to themselves, reading their work
with avidity and pleasure. Each guest would innocently
anticipate in his heart the awed silence that
would fall on the party as the last words of his poem
were read.</p>

<p>Edward thought that he would write a poem for
his party that would make everyone in the room pity
him. He would make fun of death. Everyone
would think, “Ah, poor soul, he has so much to bear,
he must have infinite courage.” And they would
think, “He has death in his eyes. Perhaps we have
not been fine enough to understand him.” Edward
thought that they would all feel a little inferior
because their health was so good. He would sit
beside Emily looking pale and brave. His deafness
would give him an air of mystic withdrawal, not
the usual air of stupidity. Nobody could ever think<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
him stupid again after his poem had been read. It
would be the first hour of his life, the first hour of
a new life.</p>

<p>But in the end he could think of no really poignant
rhyme to valley, so he selected an old poem about
death which he had written in the Tube in London.</p>

<p>Most of the guests arrived early with their poems
crackling in their bosoms. Already when Edward
reached the rather dirty little French restaurant
between two vacant lots above Chinatown there were
two motor-cars clinging precariously to the steep
cobbled street outside.</p>

<p>Melsie Ponting and two friends were shooting
craps in the low mustard-colored basement room.
Melsie greeted Edward by throwing her arms round
his instantly wooden form, pinioning him and making
him look ridiculous.</p>

<p>“I brought two boys to your party to jazz it up,”
said Melsie. “Lon, Pike, Edward, meet each other.”</p>

<p>Lon and Pike were already kindly pretending to
be drunk in order to enliven the party. Rhoda
Romero was in the room and waved flippantly at
Edward. The person behind her was not Emily,
it was only Avery Bird.</p>

<p>“I left a message for Emily. She wasn’t in,”
shouted Rhoda. Then Edward knew that Emily
would not come.</p>

<p>All round the table were little paper crabs made
by Edward in perspiring haste that afternoon, inscribed
on their backs with the names of the guests,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
and brought down in a suitcase an hour before.
Nobody noticed them. Everyone sat down without
consulting the crabs. Edward cursed the crabs because
they looked forlornly jocose and were not
noticed.</p>

<p>There were several kind persons in the room who
began to try and sit beside Edward when they
noticed him making his way to the isolated head of
the table. A thin yellow man with hair cut to resemble
a wig began describing to Edward a new mousetrap
now on sale in the Oakland hardware stores.
Edward leaned forward and smiled numbly and
thought that perhaps he was looking like a real
host.</p>

<p>Trays full of cocktails came in, borne by eager
dirty shirtsleeved waiters.</p>

<p>Emily came in behind the cocktails.</p>

<p>Edward pretended not to see her for a moment,
having a vague idea that this would make him more
valuable to Emily. Emily took off her hat with boy-like
indifference and, before hanging it on a peg,
waved it intimately at Edward.</p>

<p>“Great Scott, look at these too darling crabs.
Look, they’re supposed to show us where to sit. Oh
dear, we’ve all sat down wrong. My crab says I’m
supposed to be Mr. Herbert B. Undressed. No,
as you were. It’s Herbert B. Weinhard.”</p>

<p>A guest called Bossy was explaining to Edward
across the bosoms of two intervening ladies his misgivings
about the future of the canning trade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span></p>

<p>“Never mind,” continued Emily in a voice as clear
as a flute. “I’m going to make my crab look as if it
was called Herbert Undressed.”</p>

<p>She was drawing faces on Edward’s crabs. They
were no longer Edward’s crabs. His cute notion
was simply being made cuter by Emily.</p>

<p>“Make my crab look like me, Emily.”</p>

<p>“No, do mine first....”</p>

<p>“Make Edward’s look like Edward....”</p>

<p>There was a great deal of giggling. The air
round Emily was full of crumpled crabs. There was
one in her hair. Everyone was talking now, but
Edward was still entangled in the future of the canning
trade. His only remark in the next fifteen
minutes was, “Well, personally I never met a canner....”
He realised at last that Bossy and he
were haunted by the same fear—the fear of being
left out. The canning trade was a bond between
them. “At least we look as if we were talking,”
thought Edward. Bossy was a university instructor
with fair childlike hair contradicting the severity of
horn-rimmed spectacles and a little imperial. To
share a danger with him aroused in Edward no
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“My Lord!” he heard Melsie Ponting say. “I’m
just sick of sitting next to Lon. I’ll tell the world
he’s no gentleman. He’s just said something that
I couldn’t possibly repeat in mixed company. Would
anybody like me to?”</p>

<p>Emily shouted, “All right then, General Post!”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
Having arrived late she was sitting between two
elderly women.</p>

<p>There was a deafening snarling and roaring of
chairs pushed back. Everyone was changing seats.
Edward sat still. It was a test of his hour, he
thought, “If it really is to be my hour Emily will
come and sit by me.” The two women on his left
hand fled. Rhoda Romero on his right hand smiled
at him and moved away. Bossy moved up. Edward
was suddenly filled with panic because no-one was
coming to sit on his right. Everyone would laugh
at him. No-one was on his side. Edward rapidly
reminded himself of the few persons in his experience
who had professed to be fond of him. Jimmy
... the landlady’s daughter in Putney ... his
mother ... young Henderson at school—but he
had a clubfoot ... that amazing hatshop woman in
Regent Street—but Jimmy had taken her over....
Quite a lot of people, Edward thought, trying to
fight against his panic. “It doesn’t much matter if
nobody appreciates me here.”</p>

<p>The room was dusty and hot and there were flies.
A most exasperating fatigued fly could not muster
energy to leave the neighborhood of Edward’s lips.
Dismissed, it let itself fall through the air for half
an inch and then settled languidly again on his
face.</p>

<p>Mrs. Melsie Ponting ran up the room so that the
floor shook. She sat with a florid gesture in the
chair on Edward’s right. She looked at him with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
her head on one side, her manicured fingers fussily
arranging the beads on her breast.</p>

<p>“There there,” she said to Edward. “Was it
lonesome?” She puckered her strawberry-colored
lips towards him. She dropped first her cigarette
case and then her vanity bag. Edward felt smiling
and busy sitting beside her. He was conscious of
gratitude towards her.... The whole room was
splashing with a choppy flood of talk. Edward’s
ears hummed; he was drowning in noise.</p>

<p>“After all, I am host. It was because of me that
they all came. It is only that I haven’t pulled the
reins yet.”</p>

<p>“Did you bring a poem for us to hear?” he
asked Melsie. “If so, you must hand it to me folded,
so that I shall never know who it’s by.”</p>

<p>“My dear, you’ll kill me laughing.... Me, a
highbrow? I’d swim across the bay sooner. But
lots of the folks have brought things to read and
they’re all handing them in to Rhoda Romero. I
guess it’s that tin-trumpet voice of hers that makes
them all think she’s such a dandy reader.”</p>

<p>She asked for something. All the time she was
asking for something. She wanted a match. She
wanted another plateful of the salad which had
just been taken out of the room. She wanted a big
coffee now instead of a little coffee later. She wanted
champagne. She wanted advice about putting electric
light in her garage, about whether she ought to
let her little boy smoke cigars, about whether to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
send him to his father who had recently divorced
her.</p>

<p>Edward rarely found himself in the gratifying
position of adviser. His pleasure in the novelty,
however, was partly the pleasure of revenge. “When
Emily looks up this way she will see me being
monopolised by another woman. Serve her right.”
But Emily was perversely absorbed in Mr. Banner
Hope, who was singing in a half-whisper a song
which he hoped was coarse enough to bring him the
reputation he desired. The uncertain way in which
he sang it, however, robbed the song of whatever
sting it may originally have possessed. Mr. Hope
must often have wished that notoriety did not need
such artificial buttresses. If only some woman
would commit suicide for his sake he would be a
made man, but you never can count on women.</p>

<p>“Nobody asked Hope to sing,” grumbled Edward.</p>

<p>“They’re all treating you real mean, honey,” said
Mrs. Ponting. “Anybody would think it was that
Emily’s party.”</p>

<p>“You’re not treating me mean,” said Edward
gratefully. “Yet I don’t know.... Why were
you so keen to sit by me?”</p>

<p>“Because I wanted to ask you something,” whispered
Mrs. Ponting. “Edward, dear, I’m just crazy
to find someone plumb reliable like you going out to
China who’d take my kiddie out to his dad in the
Orient. For I guess I’ve gotter let him go. Edward,
you’d never guess what a big mother-heart<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
I’ve got back of all my nonsense. My kiddie’s just
home to me—all the home I’ve got, Edward.
You’ve never seen him but I’d just love you and him
to get together—he’s just a sunny-haired, blue-eyed,
little honest-to-God American, tall for thirteen years—just
as high as my heart, I often tell him....”</p>

<p>It was impossible for Edward not to be moved
by sentiment. He was entirely uncynical. He was
touched by vague reminders of motherhood and
home and chubby baby-fingers and other movie properties.
Yet all the time he knew that the thirteen-year-old
sunbeam in question lived at a school near
Sacramento which “made arrangements for board
during vacations,” and that he had hardly ever since
he was born had an opportunity to measure himself
against his mother’s heart.</p>

<p>“I know you must be damn fond of him and all
that,” mumbled Edward. “It must be beastly parting
with him. But you can easily get Thomas Cook
or the captain of the ship to take charge of him.
He’d be as safe as houses.”</p>

<p>“Cook me no Cooks,” said Melsie Ponting archly.
“There’s nobody to equal our Edward, don’t tell
me. And Rhoda says you’re going to China anyway.”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to China.”</p>

<p>This announcement seemed to him to be fateful.</p>

<p>“Rhoda!” shouted Melsie in a quarrelsome voice.
“You told me Edward was going to China.”</p>

<p>“So he is,” replied Rhoda with cold determination.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
She was very tired of Edward. He was a
heavy friend, poor man.</p>

<p>“He says he’s not going now.”</p>

<p>“Aw, shucks.”</p>

<p>“Rhoda, read the poetry now,” called Emily.
“I’m longing to hear everybody admire mine.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“In the darkness of my room</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I sit alone.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I am hungry;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I am thirsty;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I have no fire to warm me.</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Rhoda read it as though it were a good poem.
She had a golden, careful voice. When she had finished
she said, “I seem to have heard that some place
before.”</p>

<p>Emily added, “I think a person called Smith must
have written it.”</p>

<p>Most people were afraid that their immediate
neighbors might have written it. So only one other
guest risked a comment, a man with a white excited
face who said, “It has no sense and nothing whatever
to commend it. Speed up.” His face was
burning white with impatience; he was a fanatic
of speed. Edward, looking at him, pitied himself
because friends were so hard.</p>

<p>But really Edward was fortunate. About the
table there were those whose presence in the position
of friends Edward had not deserved or earned.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
No-one could think of San Francisco as it was in
Edward’s time without remembering certain
faces.... Those faces were part of the essential
blessing of San Francisco.</p>

<p>The face of an old man in a radiance of long
white hair and long white beard, the face of a connoisseur
of gentleness, a face that never smiled
without good cause, but in which no cause was good
enough to kindle irritation.</p>

<p>The square keen face of the only woman in the
world who can be witty even when she cries.</p>

<p>The face of a tyrant of benevolence; the only one
of his many gifts that you must always acknowledge
is his mood—if you fail to catch his mood, you
offend—and perish in an avalanche of coals of fire.</p>

<p>Another face, sharp and changing, with the complexion
of a child under careless grey hair. The
face of an eager pessimist whose imagination peopled
the worst of worlds with the best of men. He
distrusted no man, only all mankind.</p>

<p>Faces of friends from whom poor Edward was
too poor to claim friendship.</p>

<p>Rhoda read in a changed voice, with obvious
serene enjoyment:</p>

<p>“That,” said Avery Bird quickly, anxious to make
his voice heard in the first silence, “is as full of meat
as a unicorn’s belly in springtime. That’s real stuff.”</p>

<p>Other people murmured, “Too wet.” “Not sanitary.”</p>

<p>The white-faced apostle shouted, “Oh, get on, get
on. The next one can’t be worse.”</p>

<p>“I can’t seem to get a hold on the rhythm,” said
an innocent Canadian broker. Edward and he had
made friends because both were familiar with the
same supper places in the vicinity of Leicester
Square. The broker had brought his wife, a rough-hewn
looking lady, whose very hat seemed to be
chipped out of marble and ornamented with a
wooden feather.</p>

<p>“It is swollen with rhythm,” shouted Avery Bird.
“It isn’t blatant enough, of course, to allow you to
hear it. It is all that rhythm can be without being
metronomic.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Bird seemed so certain that nobody liked to
contradict him. He leaned forward tapping the
table angrily and glaring first at one fellow-guest
and then at another.</p>

<p>“Speed up. Speed up.”</p>

<p>“Negligible,” said Mr. Bird who had not yet
recovered his temper.</p>

<p>Mr. Banner Hope added, “Woman’s stuff,” to
show that he was a man.</p>

<p>Emily looked much disconcerted but she said, “I
suppose it is a bit trivial.”</p>

<p>“And foggy, too,” added an alarming University
student. “It has no message at all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span></p>

<p>“It is not worth writing or reading,” said the
white critic in a final voice.</p>

<p>“It’s a song,” objected Emily. “And songs
needn’t be messengers surely. Songs are for fancy
to hear, not for brains to digest. Perhaps songs
shouldn’t try to have any meaning at all. They
shouldn’t try really to have even words. Or perhaps
just beautiful words without sequence ... silver
and asphodel and Merrimac and darling and
mariposa and meagre and rusty....”</p>

<p>“Well, this song tries to have a meaning and
fails,” said the student. He was a dark, thick young
man, and his complacency, very logically, was not
impaired at all by the poorness of his clothes or
complexion. The fact that his collar was very high
and not at all clean seemed typical of him.</p>

<p>Edward’s heart turned cold when he thought of
his poem at the mercy of that young man. He said,
“At least that last poem makes a picture behind my
eyes.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t penetrate behind mine, I’m glad to
say,” said Melsie Ponting tartly, and many people
laughed, supposing that she had said something
witty. A smart voice is a great asset.</p>

<p>Rhoda began reading again with an abruptness
which left many dazed for a few seconds.</p>

<p>Edward saw a young woman undergraduate’s pink
face shining towards him like a sun. Her eyes
looked as though they were going to fall out. She
was waving to Edward. Edward reflected that
there were many things in the world that he did
not understand. Why should a female undergraduate
with whom he was only very slightly acquainted
wave and wink so earnestly at him across a room?
Was she feeling ill? Edward blamed himself for
not understanding. “Our hero lives as if in a
dream,” he thought. “Probably other men are
quite used to this sort of thing. Perhaps she is
making advances to me in a way entirely recognized
in certain circles.” With his brooding eyes fixed
upon the young woman, who was now pencilling a
note, Edward listened to the poem.</p>

<p>The young woman, Edward noticed, was, by
means of signs, causing her note to be passed to
Rhoda. “Notes for Rhoda but winks for me,”
thought Edward, wrestling mildly with the problem.</p>

<p>“That poet has courage,” said the high-collared
student. “To dispense wholly with form....”</p>

<p>“Yes, it needs courage to write that,” said Avery
Bird, who was narrowing his eyes and nodding his
head slowly. “It is of course callow, but then so are
the chickens of ostriches. Query, does it dispense
with form? There is a sort of antiphony—pajamas
and the Lord—the lovesick instructor and the
scream—like the leeward and windward sides of a
wall....”</p>

<p>Rhoda announced, “Some nameless person has
just passed me a note apologising for the last poem.
It was a letter really, which he or she passed me by
mistake in place of a poem.”</p>

<p>Rhoda’s voice brushed the incident aside and
everyone tried to look as wise as though nothing
had happened. Mr. Bird, only slightly disconcerted,
began to point out to his neighbor how bright was
the promise of poetry in a land where even common
correspondence had a rhythm of its own.</p>

<p>As Rhoda drew breath for another verse, Edward
noticed that his poem was the next in her sheaf.</p>

<p>And in that second or two of silence there was
heard a curious growing clamor outside. It was
like an impossibly metallic contact of wind against<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
the window. For a minute everyone in the listening
room had the insane feeling of experiencing something
inexplicable. Then the leaping bestial yell of
a fire engine approaching explained everything.</p>

<p>Mrs. Melsie Ponting was a smart woman. She
was at the door first and, like drops from a rising
mermaid, a trickle of small possessions was shaken
from her as she ran; cigarettes, a lipstick, a matchbox,
money, and the beads from a broken string.</p>

<p>“No hurry, no hurry...” shouted several men
in laboriously indifferent voices, as the scraping
chairs with one impulse shot, like splashing water,
back from the central table. One man comforted
many hearers by shouting jocosely, “Aw Gee, have
a heart, you’re on my best corn....”</p>

<p>Edward thought he would save Emily. “Our
hero’s first thought in danger was for his beloved....”</p>

<p>Emily was dancing about. “Oo, Edward, what a
party!” She was sparkling with the pride which
one feels on finding oneself present at an event. She
was determined to save her hat and threw away
blithely several hats which had alighted upon it.</p>

<p>They all arrived on the street, ashamed to have
been so tense in their efforts to reach it.</p>

<p>The fire was in a house behind the restaurant.
The fire engines were on another street, but a few
firemen were keeping a space clear of onlookers on
the vacant lots close by. The burning house had its
back to them; it was looking away from them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
towards the bay like one in agony turning away to
bite his lips. Like a tongue the smoke hung out of
one window and sparks streamed down the smoke.
There was a shaking glow on the other side of the
house which lighted up the low bending sky. An
inverted cone of smoke spun on the roof like a top.
Edward felt somehow that the whole scene was
upside down, that the sky was his vantage point,
and the blowing fire like a flower of the sky. The
cold and usual lights of fireless virgin cities round
the bay looked incredibly stupid.</p>

<p>He could feel the cold and usual Edward inside
him saying, “My party is spoilt by this damned
piece of sensationalism. My luck all over.” But,
“Oo, what a party,” was still in his ears, and his
delighted eyes were full of the fire. He was indifferent
to the poems or the twenty-five dollars owing
for the futile supper.</p>

<p>The firemen had fat jaws and looked smugly
efficient, but if one half closed one’s eyes and looked
at them one could imagine they looked like heroes.
Pursued by the dull, reluctant snakes of hose they
entered the restaurant in order to turn a fusillade
of water upon the enemy from an unexpected direction.
Looking in through the steamy window of the
basement, the delighted guests could see the bright
helmets of the heroes going round the table about
which so lately plates of commonplace pork and
beans had circulated.</p>

<p>“My poem will never be read now,” thought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
Edward. Heroes had devoured the air in which
his poem might have been read.</p>

<p>It was a very vulgar little fire after all. It would
only have a line or two in tomorrow’s <cite>Examiner</cite>.
Quite soon it admitted itself beaten, and the perforated
house sat blanketed in smoke, looking very
sheepish.</p>

<p>“Why, what d’you know about that,” said Mr.
Hope, as the first fire-engine negligently moved away
with a mild howl.</p>

<p>“Well, Edward, it’s your party,” said Rhoda.
“What shall we do about it. I’ll say it’s late and not
worth while to settle down again.”</p>

<p>“Don’t let’s read any more poems anyway,” said
Edward.</p>

<p>Everyone began to say Good-bye in the street.
All the automobiles of the guests opened their
bright eyes like sleepy servants pretending they had
never been asleep. To the loud snores of awaking
engines Emily said to Edward, “I wish the law
didn’t hate fire so. It would be fun to have a
garden of fire and plant little seedling fires in the
moonlight....”</p>

<p>“I don’t like fire. It makes a fool of one.”</p>

<p>Edward went into the restaurant to pay for the
supper. The long hot room looked tired and almost
indecent. The poems were scattered about the disordered
table. A fallen bottle of wine had given up
the ghost pillowed on a sheaf of poems and paper
crabs. Edward found his own poem—which had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
been the leader of the sheaf—disgraced and brought
very low. It was on the floor, and stamped upon it
was the wet imprint of a rubber heel. As he picked
it up he saw that Emily was waiting for him in
the doorway. She came along the room towards
him.</p>

<p>“Edward....” she said in an impatient voice,
and took his arm and shook it. He could hardly
hear what she said. She looked flushed and excited.
Did she say, “It makes my life so lovely—to be
loved?...” Did she say that?</p>

<p>Edward’s thoughts were in ashes. She was watching
him so insolently. He crumpled the muddy copy
of the poem and put it into her hand. He felt
nothing but an angry anxiety that she should love
his poem and that she should see how it had been
insulted.</p>

<p>They heard Rhoda’s voice outside, “Emily....
Emily....”</p>

<p>Mr. Banner Hope, although he wanted to be a
Blonde Beast, was of the type that is inevitably made
use of. He knew how to drive a Ford car. He
was known to know how. He therefore found it
impossible to demur when Avery Bird asked him
kindly next day if he didn’t want to drive. It is,
as everyone knows, impossible to look personally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
dangerous and daring when driving a Ford. You
have to sit up straight and there is no spare room
for your knees. These things give you a mincing,
bourgeois look. The lady seated beside the driver
of a Ford, whoever she may be, cannot help looking
like the driver’s lawful wife, or at worst, his lawful
sister. Conversely, in a racing car with a steering
wheel that bends paternally over the indolently prostrate
driver, even an aunt looks painted.</p>

<p>Avery Bird had first asked Edward Williams if
he could drive a Ford. Edward could not even
have driven a donkey. He hoped that his inefficiency
was a mark of temperament.</p>

<p>Rhoda Romero sat next to Mr. Hope, telling him
of her first love adventure and criticising his driving
in alternate breaths. Mrs. Melsie Stone Ponting
only travelled in automobiles in order to be kissed.
As soon as she was settled in the car between Avery
and Edward she began obviously discussing with
herself which man’s arm to wear round her waist.
Edward hardly counted with her as a man, still, he
was unattached. She looked from side to side but
there seemed to her to be no answer in Edward’s
eyes. So she leaned against Mr. Bird and said,
“Now let’s enjoy ourselves,” as they started.</p>

<p>The Ford seemed to Edward to be a sun round
which the golden planets of the hills revolved.
Except for a lapse into greenness after the rains,
California hills are always golden; sometimes rose-gold,
sometimes lemon-gold. Now the rains were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
almost forgotten as the travellers drove inland, but
there was a faint dream of green on some of the
slopes, a glaze or transparency of green laid lightly
on the glowing golden hills. And, besides this dream
of color, always there is a sort of dream of air
between you and the hills of California, a veil of
unreality in the intervening air. It gives the hills
the bloom that peaches have, or grapes in the
dew.</p>

<p>There was no need for Edward to talk or even
to don the rigid semi-smile which he was in the
habit of assuming, with some difficulty, when he
realised that he was watched. He could not hear
anything except an occasional scream from Melsie
Ponting.</p>

<p>At four, six, half-past six and seven they stopped
at saloons. The suggestion to stop always came
from Banner Hope, but it did not benefit him very
much, for Rhoda strictly censored anything that
passed his lips. “It would be so discouraging,” she
said, “if our driver fell down on us.”</p>

<p>At about a quarter to seven Mrs. Ponting began
to notice Edward. She looked round from the
shelter of Avery’s shoulder as one looks out of a
safe window at a poor man in the cold.</p>

<p>“Edward’s shocked,” she said; and then with a
little shriek, “Oh boy, I’ll trouble you to look at
Edward’s face.”</p>

<p>“<em>Sir</em> Walter Raleigh discovering the barbarians
of the Noo World,” said Mr. Bird, pronouncing the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
‘Sir’ with the attentive emphasis democratic America
always gives to a title.</p>

<p>Edward had already dissolved the rigid coating
of depression from his soul by means of several gin-and-vermouths.
He was therefore lost in the
thought of Emily and of the happier passages of
his life—that dinner at Romano’s when he had made
fourth to oblige Jimmy with the Silly Billy Sisters
... the afternoon on the river at Marlow when
they first left school.... Edward’s happier passages
were very rare and easy to remember. It was
only when Melsie’s attack was repeated on a higher
key—(“Now folks, go easy, we have a poyfect gentleman
in our midst”)—that he was aware of her
intention.</p>

<p>“People don’t like me,” thought Edward. “They
think I feel superior, but I am not brave enough to
feel that. They don’t know how harmless and
afraid I am.”</p>

<p>“They wouldn’t countenance such things in Britain,
would they, Edward?” said Mrs. Ponting.
“The Britisher never hugs anyone except himself.”</p>

<p>She shrieked with amusement and shouted against
the wind to Rhoda, “Say, listen, Rhoda, we’re getting
good and funny at the back here—barring Edward,
and he’s shocked.”</p>

<p>Rhoda looked round kindly at Edward. “Poor
Edward,” she said. “Say, folks, at the next saloon
there’s a dancing floor and an automatic piano.”</p>

<p>In reply to this Banner Hope of course said that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
his aunt in Fresno had an automatic piano too. But
Edward fortunately thought otherwise. Edward’s
ears thought that Banner Hope said, “He could take
her in two moves.”</p>

<p>The saloon in the next town they reached had
been optimistically built in the belief that the town
was destined to be a Center. Perhaps the town had
justified this optimism once. It was one of those
towns that homesick New Englanders built in a far
fantastic land of opportunity and broken hearts.
Its houses, separated from prim sidewalks by hedges
that were once prim, were built out of dreams of
homes left behind and of domestic ideals relinquished.
For one moment one thought oneself in
Massachusetts, but in the next moment realised that
the West had devoured all but a dream of the dream.
The shell of the town was empty, cracked and even
ruined. The fierce extravagance of California roses
covered the damage. Scrub oak, sage brush, chaparral
and prickly pear invaded the gardens of sentimental
dead miners. A wild scarlet sunset crushed
down all gentle thoughts of Salem.</p>

<p>There had been flourishing vineyards on the slopes
of the low brown hills, but these were haunted now
by the shadow of a date in the coming summer—the
date of Prohibition. Cows were tearing the vines
to pieces. Californians had given up commenting
on this common and horrible sight. There were no
new jokes to hide the despair.</p>

<p>In a row on the covered sidewalk of the town<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
were six saloons. The sidewalks were raised from
the street level and roofed against the sun, the roofs
being held up by once white hitching posts. One of
the saloons was open, the others were moribund.</p>

<p>While Banner Hope sought a nickel with which
to feed the automatic piano, the others drank a cocktail
each, but Edward drank two. He did not dance.
He was too self-conscious and too torpid to dance.</p>

<p>While the other four danced he sat at a little
lame table and felt warmth and color coming into
his mind. The sound of “He could take her in two
moves ...” was still in his ears. His eyes were
constructing a wide red sandstone chessboard. He
remembered it. Near it he was born and near it he
had lived during one-third of his life. “They kept
me too long in India,” he thought, interpolating self-pity
even with his rapture of imagination. “It
accounts for me.” The great chessboard was on a
low hill, the only hill in a yellow seamed plain that
had no limit. About the hill there was a high red
wall; the indentations of the battlements were Gothic
in shape. The buildings about the chessboard were
like dark flowers. He could see confused flat yellow
villages outside the wall from where he stood—a
pawn on the great chessboard. Near him jewels
caught the sunlight, and orange and blue arrows of
light from the jewels pierced his sight. The knights
on the chessboard wore full skirts like dancers;
they looked away from their objective; when they
leaped upon their crooked course their skirts swung<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
outward and so did their long hair. The bishops
had very thin, twisted faces and a swift, vindictive
tread. The rooks clanked as they trod, and their stiff
brocade coats were quilted. The queen’s dress was
generously made and starry, and her head was outlined
against the sunset. She ran like a boy from
end to end of the board; she skipped and jumped as
she drove the men she vanquished from their
squares; her laughter was as gay as frost. The
men whom she dismissed knelt and kissed the jewels
on her foot before they went. The upper sky was
the color of grapes and near the earth it was the
color of wine. Against that sky the pawn that
was Edward was content only to see the delicate
insolent outline of the queen’s form. He could take
her in two moves....</p>

<p>“The superior gentleman,” said Mrs. Melsie
Ponting, sitting on his knee so violently that not
only Edward but the whole floor shuddered. She
was becoming every moment more anxious to appear
naughty and this was delighting Banner Hope, who
could now feel that he was living a deliciously wild
life without effort. It was no effort to sweep Melsie
from Edward’s knee on to his own. The impulse
for this manœuvre was hers.</p>

<p>Rhoda Romero, though averse to the knees of
strangers and suffering from the drawback of an
innate dignity, was anxious not to seem behindhand.
She demanded a challenge to “get together” with a
couple of cowboys who had just entered and were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
shooting craps at the bar. They wore flaring leather
chaps with leather buckles, leather waistcoats over
red shirts, high boots stitched in a floral design and
hats of dark beaver, very broad, very high and
pointed. Rhoda approached them with a rather
charming suggestion of swagger and asked them
where they got their hats. One cowboy answered
in a low self-conscious voice, and Rhoda returned to
her table with disappointment in her face.</p>

<p>“From a movie company,” she said a little sheepishly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Melsie Ponting shrieked, not with laughter,
but with excitement. She hoped that the cowboys
would look at her but they did not. “Such is
life ... such is life ...” bellowed Banner Hope.
Avery Bird said, “Let’s go,” but Edward, as a defensive
movement against Melsie, ordered one more
gin-old-fashioned each, including a couple for the
cowboys.</p>

<p>“Mr. Williams is wegging ub,” said Melsie Ponting
more kindly. It seemed to them all extraordinary
that so bare a room should be so delightfully
full of confusion. Everything seemed hot, and especially
hot was the finger of one of the cowboys
tapping Edward’s knee.</p>

<p>“And it’s not the first time either,” the cowboy
was saying. “I surely did draw a bum card when I
got my old girl....”</p>

<p>“What got her goat this time?” asked Rhoda.</p>

<p>An anecdote seemed to tangle itself about Edward’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
exhausted understanding: “... a peach of
a dame ... foreigner I guess ... gave my mare
the once over.... ‘Sure, sister,’ I said ... there
she was careening down the grade on my mare....”</p>

<p>“Gadarening would be a good word for that,”
thought Edward.</p>

<p>“My God, I said, if the mare isn’t acting like she
was going to take the girl home to my old girl ...
and sure ’nuff.... This foreign dame I’m telling
you of rides back ... kinda queer her way of talking
was.... ‘Your wife’s after me and you,’ she
says ... and back of her, sure ’nuff, come the old
girl.... She was blue’s a lemon when she got
here....” He broke off. “Well, presence of
ladies ...” he added, smiling fatuously. “Her
language ... sour as a lemon she was, yapped
like a coyote.... And the foreign dame laughed
... put her head down and kinda sobbed for
laughing ... <em>she</em> should worry....”</p>

<p>“I believe it was Emily,” said Avery Bird suddenly.</p>

<p>“You betcher it was Emily,” agreed the cowboy,
realising that his story was improved by this fact.
“It would be. Emily for mine every day of the
week not forgetting Sundays....”</p>

<p>Edward and the cowboy inadvertently walked out
hand in hand. The cowboy retained Edward’s hand
even while he affectionately shook the hand of every
other member of the party. The trees and the
houses and the cowboy suddenly slid away to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
re-awakened tune of the Ford’s engine. Only the
stars and the moon accompanied the party.</p>

<p>They drove the car at last through a gate into a
broad moonlit hayfield. It was like a stage set and
lighted for a great ballet. There were no dancers
but the moon and the haycocks. All the haycocks
bowed before the moon.</p>

<p>Rhoda and Melsie chose a haycock against which
to spread their blankets. Avery Bird and Banner
Hope burrowed into another haycock. Edward, by
himself, chose yet another. He arranged his blankets
and then stepped back with his head on one side
like an artist. There never was seen such an exquisite
place to sleep in. In different parts of the
field the others were singing, catching an infection
of song one from another.</p>

<p>“Oh dig my grave both wide and deep ...” sang
Edward hoarsely.</p>

<p>When he lay down the upright blades of hay
moved in the breeze against the sky. There was
one that was like a pen writing upon the sky.</p>

<p>“In an hour and a half I can say, ‘Today I shall
see Emily,’” he said. But in an hour and a half he
said nothing. He could hear an owl through his
sleep, but he said nothing.</p>

<p>The line of sunlight, as Edward woke, was climbing
down the opposite hillside as the sun fought its
daily preliminary battle with the eastern mountains.
On the near hillside, pine tree after pine tree flamed
in the descending green light. When the woods that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
bordered the fields achieved their morning, shafts
of gold dust slanted between the trees. There
was a dark brilliant red in the shadows of the
woods.</p>

<p>Cinders in hot cakes taste glorious under an early
sun. Mrs. Ponting was sleepy and a little more kind
than usual. She sat plaiting her hair and giving
directions to the men while Rhoda efficiently cooked
hot cakes. Edward, who had walked a very long
way into the forest in search of wood, returned with
half a dozen twigs and with news of a bear’s track
which he had discovered in a patch of wet sand by
a stream—the great print of the palm and three precise
dents for the claws. The fire was so fierce under
the frying pan that his characteristically poor contribution
was devoured in it like a War-savings
Stamp in the cost of the Great War. But he
thought, “I can tell Emily I heard the bear crackling
in the undergrowth. I might say I couldn’t
swear to it and then it wouldn’t be a lie. Anyway
she is a liar herself. But liars don’t necessarily approve
of liars.”</p>

<p>They all sang during half the day. Along the
road which followed the pale green foothills they
sang; the squirrels, escaping to the embrace of mean
and ragged foothill pines, clasped their hands upon
their breasts in pious surprise as the loud song
passed by to the kettledrum accompaniment of the
Ford. The heads of gophers shot out of their holes
and in again, till the slope bubbled with half-seen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
creatures in the sun, like boiling water. A snake
oozed like quicksilver across the road.</p>

<p>Higher and higher. The steep slopes were
heaped with dogwood and buck-eye and awakening
azaleas. Mariposa lilies stood in the cool shadow.
A couple of deer waded in the lilies. Sometimes a
web of cloud-blue lilac was spun from tree to tree.
The dark wine-colored Judas tree was nearly over.</p>

<p>The forest presently closed about the travellers.
They were prisoners. The very passing miles held
them closely prisoners. The trees were wrought
steel bars between them and their sunlit and delirious
cities. The noise of the car was beneath the
notice of the silence. The silence of the forest was
much louder than their voices or than the stuttering
of hearts and engines.</p>

<p>Their eyes leapt absurdly and inevitably up the
shafts of the trees. When the striped earth sloped
the trees sprang at one angle from the slope like
javelins thrown against one enemy, the sun. The
sky seemed stabbed by the javelin trees. The high
down-pointing cones were barbs, closely embedded
in sky.</p>

<p>The sunlight stood in fluted slanting columns
hardly more ephemeral than the trees. There was
an obsession of trees in Edward’s mind. Out of the
corners of his eyes he could see an unceasing bustle
of birds and squirrels and insects among the trees,
like a hinted joke on lips that were sealed when he
looked directly at them. Everything was secret.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
A few acres of the forest were secretly and quietly
on fire. It was the spirit of fire with its eyes shut,
intensely malevolent. There was but little flame;
a little dagger of flame or two, as though the keeper
of the savage secret could barely refrain from committing
himself. Blue smoke curled from the roots
in the ground; thin snakes of smoke writhed about
the innocent strong trunks of the trees. The air was
hot and the hanging pale scarves of lichen waved in
the heat. It was an intense relief to leave the smoke
behind and pass through the living, unthreatened
spaces of cool forest again.</p>

<p>There was a pause in the day at the foot of a
monstrous horned tree. An experiment on the part
of the Creator but not, Edward thought, a very
successful one. Trees should be young and shining
or they should be immortal and carry their age like
a gentle green dream. The greatest sequoia of all
is a horned devil with a senile brow. The weight
of his thousands of years is like a torpid curse upon
him. One thinks miserably of his contemporaries,
Moses and the jewelled Pharaohs, and one is glad
that the ancients died decently and thoroughly and
are only very sparsely survived. Some of the trees
on the slope—younger by a thousand years or so—were
very much more splendid. The grain of their
rough and rusty bark ran up in slow spirals—for
ever, it seemed. No great branches drew the eye
away from its climb upward to the tapering spear
of the tree. Only, far up, near the sun, the little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
delicate branches and needles sprang out and shone
like the drops of a fountain.</p>

<p>“Why, why, why ...” said Mr. Hope, after
reading the notice board at the foot of the horned
tree. He gave the tree a quick congratulatory
glance and said to Edward, “Say listen, you don’t
get trees like that where you come from.”</p>

<p>Edward’s mind ran home. “No,” he agreed
vaguely. “Not trees like this. No notice-boardy
trees like this. Primroses, of course, and what
not.”</p>

<p>“Your notice boards in Britain,” said Avery
Bird, “say ‘Trespassers will be shot at sight,’ or
something very like it. Our notice boards in California
say ‘See here, folks, come and look at this
tree,’ or some such thing.”</p>

<p>“That’s true,” admitted Edward. “Still, it’s
more fun to disobey a notice board warning you off
than to obey a notice board calling you on.” I am
not sure that he really said this. If he did I do not
think anyone heard him. After a second or two he
realised at any rate that he might have said it and
he thought, “Really, you know, I am quite clever.
Only Emily is never there when I am clever. Nobody
is on my side. There is nobody to think,
‘Well, by Jove, our hero is not so very unworthy
of his Emily after all....’”</p>

<p>The grotesque dance of the Ford car between the
quiet trees began again. Back and forth, back and
forth, along the climbing roads it toiled. Higher<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
and higher. There were patches of old crusted
snow beside the road now. The little meadows
among the trees were extravagantly green. The
very shadows were green.</p>

<p>The earth opened before them. There was suddenly
nothing at all between them and another
world. The faces of the opposite mountains—El
Capitan, Half Dome—were made gracious with
Gothic curves. There were far mountains—red
mountains, patterned with snow—to the east of the
Half Dome. They were like still flames in the low
red sunlight. Yosemite Valley was filling with blue
shadow as the sun went down. The line of shadow
climbed up the sheer cliffs like rising water and overflowed
the tall shallow arches of the cliffs.</p>

<p>Edward thought, “I can’t bear to be alone with
this. One can’t be anything but alone in such an
indecently enormous world. There is nothing that
will ever come near enough to save me.... Unless
Emily would come....”</p>

<p>Avery Bird said, “The other party ought to be
quite a short ways from here. They’d planned to
wait for us before going down into the valley.
Let’s all call Emily, let’s sing Emily all through the
woods.”</p>

<p>“Emily ... Emily ... Emily....”</p>

<p>They moved along the shadowy road. The sunlight
slipped from the brim of the lower cliffs across
the valley. The brows of the mountains were still
alight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span></p>

<p>“Listen,” said Rhoda, and Mr. Hope, listening to
excess, stalled the engine by mistake.</p>

<p>“Hurray.... Hurray....”</p>

<p>It was a very small distant voice. There was a
very small distant Emily framed in tall trees. It
seemed to Edward that all the trees they had seen
had been but an avenue leading to Emily. She was
waving violently at them with both arms. She ran
towards them.</p>

<p>“A deer came and almost kissed me,” she shouted
urgently as she ran. “We didn’t light the fire till
now for fear of frightening it. The darling thing.
We are going to have four fried eggs each. We
bought all the eggs in the last town.”</p>

<p>“I guess you got to admit now that London has
nothing on this,” said Banner Hope.</p>

<p>Leaning over a doubtful camp fire knelt Emily’s
employer and his wife. Emily danced about them
without dignity. “Isn’t it fine? Isn’t it fine? Soon
it will be all starry above and we shall be just seeing
each other’s nice faces and eating four fried eggs
each.”</p>

<p>“You spoil things by expecting them too much,
Emily,” said her employer, snatching facetiously at
her dancing ankle.</p>

<p>Tam McTab, that eminent journalist, had a large
dark complacent face. His eyes, unexpectedly, were
very pale grey. They were like lapses into vagueness
in a vivid face. He had straight black hair,
the front lock of which seemed grown at a different<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
angle from the rest and either fell obliquely across
his forehead or was blown upward by the wind.
He had rather a fat, satisfied chin. He stooped,
not so much with slackness as with alertness, as
though he were leaning forward to catch the sound
of something passing.</p>

<p>His wife, Lucy, had a round, rather indeterminate
face and pale drooping hair. Her clothes
made her look collapsible and boneless. Even her
hat was draped rather than set upon her head. Her
lips looked stiff as though she were biting them
constantly.</p>

<p>Edward knelt at her side and looked at the fire
rather helplessly. He lit several matches but they
went out without doing any good. Rhoda Romero
took command.</p>

<p>It was dark at last and the stars crept in procession
across the space of sky above them. The
fire, a slowly spreading ring of fire rooting itself
among the pine-needles, was between Edward and
Emily. Lucy sat beside Edward.</p>

<p>“Are you fond of reading?” asked Lucy nervously
of Edward. She was trying to make a little safe
alcove of conversation in the great silence that stood
about them. She had not intended anyone else to
hear her; she was obviously not really anxious to
know whether Edward was fond of reading. But
she was accustomed to rooms and to a polite murmur
of talk.</p>

<p>Emily heard her and said gushingly to Tam,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
“Do you play tennis, or is blue your favorite color?
Lucy has brought the drawing-room even here.
Lucy, won’t you even take off your hat? Is it because
of the angels? St. Paul’s angels aren’t in the
forest, surely.”</p>

<p>Edward was hardly ever scornful except of himself.
He knew too well the difficulties and dangers
involved in being alive to despise those who sought
for safety in tremulous platitudes.</p>

<p>“I write more than I read,” he admitted in so
low a voice that even the mocking Emily could not
catch it. “I don’t write well, but I love writing.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how clever of you,” said Lucy. “I’d have
loved to write but I never could at all, I’m sure.
It’s a gift, isn’t it, really? Tam writes wonderfully.
But then he does everything well. He reads a great
deal too. He often says he doesn’t know where he
would be without his books. He reads wonderfully
well aloud. Even here he has brought books.
What is the name of the man who wrote that sad bit
of poetry—the ‘Song of the Shirt?’ George Moore.
I saw some books of his in Tam’s suitcase. I always
tell him—half in fun, you know—camping isn’t the
place for reading. I admire scenery awfully, don’t
you? I am a very observatory person—I often
notice things that Tam missed altogether, and then
I tell him and sometimes he puts it in his books.
That is to say, he did once....”</p>

<p>Her uncertainty robbed her manner of the slightest
trace of enthusiasm. She bit her lips and looked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
at Edward to see if he was listening. She seemed
to be chronically unflattered.</p>

<p>Edward felt ease and complacency covering him
as she spoke, just as he felt the warmth of the fire
enveloping his happy body.</p>

<p>“Yes, I love looking at great things,” he said in
a proud throaty voice. “I am myself no reader
anywhere, out of doors or indoors.”</p>

<p>Emily was still rudely listening. Nobody else
seemed to be talking. Emily was laughing a little.
The low fire made a poppy-yellow light on the point
of her chin, a theatrical light. A duller light was
on the soft silk shirt that followed the gentle lines
of her breasts.</p>

<p>“I have got an idea again,” said Emily, thumping
the pine needles excitedly with both her hands.
“Oh, now I come to think of it, I can’t say it so that
it sounds a very good idea. It’s about being honest.
Did I talk about it before?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Tam, and Emily’s body relaxed with
disappointment. Edward thought that Tam was as
hard as concrete and that certainly Emily would
never bear to be laughed at or to be beaten at games.
He was quite sure that she would behave badly at
games and contradict the umpire.</p>

<p>“Well then,” said Emily rather lamely, “I’ll talk
about it again. Don’t you think it’s tremendously
interesting to make people be honest against their
will? To startle people suddenly into being honest
about their standards—about why they cry and why<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
they laugh and when they lie and how much they
pose? Posing especially. Although everybody
poses, only about ten percent I should think laugh
secretly at their own poses. People’s poses make
them slow to admit, for instance, that they laugh
only when there is something a little dirty in the
joke, or that they cry when their conceit is wounded,
or that they powder their noses to attract men and
not for the health of their complexions, or that they
lie. Let’s all pose as being absolutely honest. Lucy,
quick—how much do you lie?”</p>

<p>Lucy bit her lips. She made a little tower of
sticks at the edge of the fire and tried to convey a
little torch of flames to the tower. “Why, Emily,
don’t talk like that. I try not to lie at all, of
course.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I try frightfully hard to lie,” said Tam.
“I am always deeply disappointed if I do not succeed
in deceiving everyone I know about what I am
and what I have whenever I want to.” He spoke
of himself with great confidence and with an obvious
certainty that whatever he chose to say about himself
was interesting. One felt that he would just as
complacently have explained that he always used
Vinolia Soap or that he preferred silk socks to
woollen ones.</p>

<p>“Oh, you naughty, naughty man!” said Melsie
Ponting. “As for me, I only lie to make a funny
yarn funnier. I never mean to deceive a fly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span></p>

<p>“I lie to save myself from myself,” said Edward.
He thought this sounded modest and tragic.</p>

<p>“I lie when I am angry or when I am frightened,”
said Rhoda. “If I were always calm I should
never lie at all, I guess. Except that I never tell
anything that happened to me exactly the way it
happened.”</p>

<p>“I have no conscience at all,” Banner Hope
said. “I remember when my Momma used to catch
me stealing the candies....”</p>

<p>“Truth,” announced Avery Bird, “is a bastard
begotten by a steam-locomotive and born of the
scent of jasmine—if you get me. Truth is the
ghost of a decadent vice, clanking steel chains;
Mary Magdalene was crucified on truth instead of
a wooden cross——”</p>

<p>“Oh, for the land’s sake, Avery,” exclaimed
Rhoda. “Do you have to act so damned complex?
Nobody gets you, believe me. It’s because he’s a
Jew....” she added apologetically to the others as
she took Avery’s hand.</p>

<p>“I think you’re all posing,” said Emily. Her
clenched hands became slack, as though with disappointment.
“If I began to say how much I lied I
should pose as a miserable sinner. Yet I do lie, to
save myself from the anger—which I deserve—of
other people. And I lie often in order to seem
uniquely honest. Oh, hang it all, there’s no getting
away from pose after all. We’re all posing as liars<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
now because it’s more popular and funny to be
liars——”</p>

<p>“Lucy didn’t,” said Tam, as though Lucy were
his property.</p>

<p>Emily interrupted, “It was the talk of reading
and writing that reminded me. While I was lying
in the sun before supper I tried to read George
Moore’s Confessions of a Young Man. I thought
Tam would presently ask me what I thought of it
and I began trying and trying to think of something
clever I could say—something that would sound so
clever that even Tam wouldn’t dare to strip the skin
of cleverness from what I should say and see how
light and womanly was the core of my thinking.
And then I thought it would be fun to say to myself
what I really did think, not trying to show off. So
I read the book with one hand and wrote everything
that occurred to me with the other.”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose we’d better hear what you
wrote,” said Tam, knocking out his pipe in a jovially
resigned way.</p>

<p>“Tam, don’t you really want to hear?”</p>

<p>“I see you are determined to let us hear.”</p>

<p>Edward thought, “I certainly have no delusions
about her. I can see that she monopolises talk too
much. And she talks entirely about herself. Having
no delusions about her I can see the more clearly
how adorable she is.”</p>

<p>“When I read my notebook now it is like a fog<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
translated into words. Yet I swear this is all I
thought about George Moore, and I am not abnormally
stupid.”</p>

<p>“No indeed,” said Banner Hope helpfully.</p>

<p>“This is what I find in my notebook:</p>

<p>‘Why not die if you are Victorian? <i>Terrible is the
day when each sees his own soul naked.</i> But his
soul is all dressed up in tight trousers and what not.
And side-whiskers. I wonder if my navy shirt is
too tight? My mind is wandering. I must read
this book acutely. <i>I fain would show my soul.</i> Mrs.
Felicia Hemans toying with adultery. My first
schoolroom had a green wallpaper. What’s this
about Scott. <i>Too impersonal.</i> Who cares for the
effect of Scott now? Might as well care for the
effect of Little Arthur’s History. Oh, what roguey
rogue he is trying to be. <i>Of course I liked the
fashionable sunlight in the Park, and to shock my
friends ... I boasted of my dissipations.</i> Now he
boasts of his boasting and that is just as bad. <i>A
satyr carrying a woman.</i> How laboriously luscious.
But why not laboriously luscious? He’s got
to give his Young Man something to Confess. But
in these days we would laugh at his Young Man.
Because he isn’t young. He’s only pretending to
be traditionally young. <i>I cannot recall a case of man
or woman who ever occupied any considerable part
of my thoughts that did not contribute to my moral
or physical welfare.</i> He is very proud of that.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
He thinks that using people makes him great. Men
are vainer than women. Or naïver. Talking of
vanity, I’d like leather buttons on my coat like a
man’s. They would look sort of tawny. <i>Beginning
to regard the delineation of a nymph or youth bathing
as a very narrow channel to carry off the tide
of a man’s thought.</i> How very good all this is.
How honest of him to admit his impression of Impressionists.
The shocker shocked. Hurray. He
is not a spirit shocker but a flesh shocker. It is certainly
fair of him to admit his vulgarity—if only he
knew how vulgar it was. I don’t know about all
this. I don’t know Théophile Gautier. I am a fool.
I am a woman. Why do they let women be like me,
skipping the strange parts of books? I think the
needles on the pine trees are woven like Japanese
matting against the sky. I am bored. I am bored.
Now I am not bored. I am proud of being not
bored; I am proud because the quotations from
Gautier please me so. I am applying it all to myself.
Oh, he is laughing at me. Being a woman,
that’s the trouble. <i>Pity, that most vile of vile virtues,
has never been known to me.</i> Is it being a
woman that prevents me from understanding how
pity can be vile? Women are paid to pretend to
understand men’s epigrams. Epigrams about virtues
are easy. Pity isn’t really vile, only there are
three sexes, men, women and people who pity. <i>It
is said that the tiger will sometimes play with the
lamb. Let us play.</i> He is laughing in a laboriously<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
aesthetic way. He is pulling the nineteenth century’s
leg, but the twentieth century can pull his. It is all
Victorian smart like a minor novelist’s club. Affectations
of an out-of-date “deliciously naughty fellow.”
Written for sheltered women. <i>The real
genius for love lies not in getting into but getting
out of love.</i> All right. But does the word love
catch every woman’s eye as it catches mine?
<i>Pythons.... Persian cats....</i> Are men then
really so naïve? No woman would bother to retail
such Garden Suburb vice. Or do I not understand
the joke? Yes, I know he wrote it when he was
young. But he re-published it when he was old.
Has he not noticed what has happened to the world
since he wrote it? It is re-published in fun ... as
a survival. If I were cleverer I would have been
laughing all along. But it is proud of its Bohemianism.
The game of being a Bohemian can only be
played with a smiling mind. You can’t have a smiling
mind among Pythons and Persian cats. No—<i>Hypocritical
reader, in telling you of my vices I am
only telling you of your own, in showing you my
soul I am only showing you your own.</i> When he
talks of readers and souls and vices like that he is
using a dead language. The reader he apostrophizes
is dead. He has the sustained smirk of a
John Leech “Toff.” He is an inverted Pollyanna.
Now I am in America. We don’t pretend now.
We don’t leer. When we leer we see ourselves in
the glass now.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span></p>

<p>Tam McTab said, “By Jove, Emily, you ought
to be shot. You are terrifying. You are too conscious,
you frighten one.”</p>

<p>“Tam, do I frighten you? Tam, say quickly, do
I frighten you?”</p>

<p>“Not so much as you might,” he said. “Because
we are all somehow metallically unsimple in these
days. I am too. We can’t even be naked without
noticing it. We can’t even think without thinking
about thinking. But you are too unsimple to be
allowed to live, really. It is simple and human to
pose a bit and not to know you are posing. When
you try to know yourself so well you devastate yourself.
You are conspicuously inhuman even in an
inhuman age. You are too hard-hearted to have
delusions and to make mistakes and love yourself
peacefully as everyone else does. If you hit nails
on the head you do it savagely, with a purpose, and
kill something with it—as Jael did.”</p>

<p>It was suddenly apparent that Emily was crying,
but she made no sound and said no word. Her
eyes looked round and strained and the firelight
caught the tears on her lower lashes.</p>

<p>“Is that a bird calling?” asked Lucy mildly.
Lucy’s cindery hand was nervously poking the fire
with a twig.</p>

<p>Information was generally left for Rhoda to give.
“It is not a bird. It is a man whistling.”</p>

<p>The firelight glared suddenly and cast all their
shadows outward in a circle. Their shadows were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
like the petals of a dark flower with a flaming
centre.</p>

<p>They listened to the sound of approaching steps
across the soft pine needles. Edward listened but
he could not hear. A panic seized him because he
could not hear. “Probably the forest is full of
great sound. They talk of birds and whistling.
The world can’t be nearly as still as my world is.
My hearing reaches no further than the light of the
fire. I have no impersonal hearing at all. Perhaps
they can all hear that waterfall across the valley and
perhaps owls and the tread of deer. I should be
ashamed to tell Emily how little I can hear, although
I can always hear her voice. I am defective.
Our hero in a tragic mood of self-realisation.
Our hero indeed! I am not even my own hero.”</p>

<p>He drew back a little from the dancing light of
the fire because he wished to have shadow on his
eyes which were filling with tears of self-contempt
and self-pity.</p>

<p>“Real men never cry,” he told himself. “What
is the matter with me that I have never grown up
into a man? Here are two men coming out of the
forest. They need a shave. They have big muscles
under their skin. Even when they get drunk
they probably never cry and surely they never hate
themselves. I don’t love Emily—as either of those
two men could love her. I love her deafly and
drunkenly and neurotically. Is there no happiness
at all for poor things?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span></p>

<p>The two unshaven strange men he was looking
at stood in the outer radius of the firelight. It
was amazingly unlikely that they should have found
the campers, it seemed. Edward thought that he
and Emily and the others were like bees hidden in
their flower of flame and shadow. But now they
were found.</p>

<p>“Any of you folks got a match?” asked one of
the strangers. He added when he had lighted his
pipe, “Why, you’re San Francisco folks, aren’t you?
I know because I had the pleasure of listening to
you, Miss Romero, addressing a meeting of the
What is Liberty Association last week. Say, did
you know the office of the W. I. L. A. had been
raided? Sure it has. I wouldn’t of known it only
that I happened to be right there on the stairs when
the police hit the place. Took my name and address
and showed me the door.”</p>

<p>“Why, what d’you know about that?” murmured
Banner Hope. Rhoda looked rather white.</p>

<p>“Have a drink, strangers?” said Avery Bird.</p>

<p>Days and nights went by under the trees. The
travellers went down into the Yosemite Valley itself.
At one hour the subtle shape of Half Dome was
suggested through a robe of morning mists, at
another it was hewn starkly out of a hard sky.
They confronted the incredible grained and golden
face of El Capitan, that perfect half of an unknown
whole, that perpendicular desert of stone which
bares its naked heart to the sun and whose boundaries
march with those of the clouds. There was for
days a sound of falling waters always. Edward
did not hear it, but he could see the thin silken bands
of water binding the mountains, and he could lie at
the feet of falls in an explosion of light spray and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
watch the stars shoot out of the smooth high brim
of the fall three thousand feet above him.</p>

<p>The red pine ground was their bed between the
crimson and golden trunks of trees. There was
always light on the river and often, it seemed, a
light within the river, a twisting snake of light.</p>

<p>Yosemite was printed like a dream upon that
part of the memory that registers impossible
things....</p>

<p>They were motoring westward again through the
gold country—Eldorado. The two Fords were
together now, Tam driving the first. Lucy was in
the front seat beside Tam. Emily and Edward sat
in the back.</p>

<p>“I have never really driven a car before this
trip,” said Tam as they started. “In England I
am no motorist, though a friend’s Rolls Royce occasionally
wears Lucy and me as buttons. But I am
no driver and it alarms me to have anyone but Lucy
in the seat beside me.”</p>

<p>Lucy looked at the country with a patient expression.
The angle of her head followed the line of
the hills. The line was like a feverish temperature
chart against the sky and Lucy watched it with uncritical
attention.</p>

<p>Emily put her hand upon Edward’s thin arm.
“You know, Edward,” she said, “you’re a masochist.”</p>

<p>“I suppose I am,” said Edward despondently.
“What is it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span></p>

<p>“A person who enjoys hurting himself.”</p>

<p>Edward considered this.</p>

<p>“That’s what makes me want to love you without
being loved,” he thought. “Yes, I want that.
I want to be hurt and to make myself sick with pitying
myself. I want to ensure that you shouldn’t love
me by telling you the worst about myself.”</p>

<p>He found it suddenly a real effort to be silent.
He wanted to tell her how unhappy he was; he
wanted to try and make her cry for him, or rather
to satisfy himself that she would never cry for him.
He wanted to tell her how often his head hurt and
how poorly his ears served him and of the unbearable
thundering and crashing that was always in
the foreground of his hearing. He wanted to tell
her how impossible he found it not to drink too
much, how impossible he found it to be like other
men. He wanted her to say, “Poor Edward, poor
man...” and stroke his hand.</p>

<p>He said, “Emily, are you really as hardhearted
as Tam says?”</p>

<p>They both looked suddenly at Tam. He was
telling Lucy in his usual absolutely confident way of
some small experience of his own—an experience
that would not have been worth describing had it
not been for his own intense interest in it. They
heard him say, “And the silly part of it was that if
I hadn’t been wearing those old grey flannels the
feller wouldn’t have dared to speak to me like
that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span></p>

<p>He had a habit of speaking to Lucy as if she
were not his wife but a friend.</p>

<p>Emily leaned her head suddenly on Edward’s
shoulder. “How can you be so brutal?” she said.
“How can you ask me if I am hardhearted when I
am in such pain—and all for love....”</p>

<p>She never could keep her hands still. She threw
out her right hand as if in surrender and hammered
the side of the car. Edward could feel that she was
absolutely tense. The muscles of her neck were
unyielding.</p>

<p>He thought, “I must be very cautious.” He understood
that he was not in Emily’s world at all.
“I must be very cautious even in thinking of her
now....” It was like falling into very cold water
and becoming at once numb. “I mustn’t be feeble
in this too. I must be a hero in another way. If
I love her without hope, in the end I must die because
the pain will grow and grow.” He looked
forward almost eagerly to atrocious pain forever.
The forever of the morbid introspective is not a real
eternity. I believe he looks forward in the very end
of the end to telling God and being publicly pitied
and caressed at last. “Well done, thou good and
faithful servant, thou hast been alone and unfortunate
in all things. Enter thou into the unending
pity of thy Lord.”</p>

<p>The wind blew back to them something that
Lucy was saying. “Well, it’s just as I always told
you, Tam. You never know what you can do till<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
you try.” They were being briskly polite to each
other. They were what is called in sprightly domestic
literature, “Good Comrades.”</p>

<p>“When you asked me if I were hardhearted,
Edward,” said Emily, “I suppose you were going to
tell me something about yourself.”</p>

<p>“I was,” replied Edward. “But I won’t now.
Anything I could say to you now would seem too
big to me and too little to you. My love, for instance.
And the fact that I must miss everything
in the world....”</p>

<p>“Your deafness....” said Emily. “I gathered
you were a bit deaf even before Melsie Ponting
told me you were as deaf as a post. Tam said—‘Yes,
and as slow as a Sunday post’—but I told him
to shut up. It must be beastly being deaf because I
suppose you feel that you seem stupid and that
people get tired of talking to you. Why don’t you
go to a doctor and all that? I always go to doctors
the very minute I have a symptom—doctors are so
awfully interested and lean forward when I talk
about myself, which of course nobody else will ever
do. Other people tiresomely begin talking about
themselves as soon as I get going, but luckily doctors
never do that. Tam is the only person I know
who can talk successfully about himself, but then he
is always perfectly happy about himself and talks of
what happened when a vital button came off at his
wedding, or how pleased somebody was to see him
when he called, or why an Armenian mistook him for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
a Turk. And everybody listens with a poised smile
on their lips, and when he has finished there is always
a loud noise of success. Sure and happy people
never fall flat. Edward, if you weren’t so sad-hearted,
people would love you much more.”</p>

<p>“That’s what happy-hearted people always say,”
said Edward. “Happiness and sadness are not attributes
and not moods. They are the foundations
on which people are built. You can’t change your
foundations.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you are sad, your castle is built on
sand. It is so safe to be well and truly laid on a
happy and a rocky heart. Then even pain is nothing
more than storms beating on the rock. When
the storm goes down you are wet and perhaps a
shade chipped but still safe.”</p>

<p>“I am never safe,” said Edward. “Never safe
for a second.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I am so tired of talking about you and me,
Edward dear,” said Emily sitting up.</p>

<p>They were silent and Edward felt as if he were
learning Emily’s face by heart and as if it were a
lesson knowledge of which would be most urgently
required of him some day. Her upper lip was
thinner than the lower and, though the upper lip did
not protrude beyond the lower at all, the effect of a
little uptilted pout was produced by the line below
her mouth which receded very definitely before jutting
out to form a rather large round chin. Her
nose was strong and rather broad, absolutely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
straight in profile and a little tilted. Tilted lines
were necessary in her face to support her slanting
thick black brows and the upward angle of her dark
hair. She was smaller than most people and looked
as if she were accustomed to putting her shoulders
back and looking half defiantly up into the eyes of
large, strong, delighted men.</p>

<p>There were no level places in the land they were
passing through and no color except a hot brown.
The air shook in the heat; the summits of the brown
dead hills seemed to be seen through shaken water.
There were scars in the hills made by old gold-seekers
here and there, and surviving one-man mines
stabbed the slopes. Small villages of bleak grey
shacks clung to the road. The sunset turned the
brown to red; the air in the shadow of the hills was
russet red. It was time to find a camp site. Whenever
they turned a corner and looked down, as it
seemed, upon a perfect site, some little town had
chosen that site too. There was no remoteness in
that strange broad land.</p>

<p>“This damned country has broken out into a rash
of towns,” complained Tam.</p>

<p>One of the intrusive little towns seemed to attract
the sunset. Its windows flamed in orange; its roofs
smouldered in dull crimson.</p>

<p>“It’s like as if it was on fire,” said Lucy. “Stop,
Tam, and let me look.” Lucy always had to look
where the others only glanced.</p>

<p>“Lot’s wife,” said Tam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span></p>

<p>“One thing, by the way, that we know because the
Bible tells us so,” said Emily, “is that Lot didn’t
care a damn for his wife. If he had cared he would
at least have looked round at her predicament; probably
he would have tried to help her or melt her or
something. We should have known if he had because
he would have been preserved forever as a
pillar, a monument to conjugal gentlemanliness.
The cad.”</p>

<p>“We ought to get under cover. It’s going to
rain; the cows are lying down,” said Lucy restlessly.</p>

<p>“Oh well, even a cow is human and may err,”
said Emily.</p>

<p>But the stars became gradually absorbed in darkness.</p>

<p>As the final darkness fell they came to a deserted
village consisting of a roadhouse, a shack or
two and a barn, all empty. The travellers had with
them dill pickles, a cucumber, canned tomatoes, raw
eggs, raw potatoes and soda-crackers. They had
also accumulated various bottles, one of very fulsome
country-saloon port wine, two of gin, one of
vermouth and two of whiskey.</p>

<p>The meal, eaten seated on the bare floor of the
old roadhouse, seemed blessed. There was so much
to drink. They all felt as if they had left themselves
gloriously behind. There was no hint of life in the
village except—far off—the asthmatic and difficult
cry of a donkey. And a dog strayed in and
joined the travellers. It did not seem to mind the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
fact that they all tried to be funny at its expense.
Tam pulled its tail, lifted it up by its tail.</p>

<p>“The way to flatter a dog,” said Emily, “is to
say, ‘What a nice new tail you are wearing today,
darling.’ Dogs are frightfully sensitive about criticism
of their tails. Of course most dogs have only
one tail which they wear weekdays and Sundays,
but they would never admit that. They only think
to themselves, ‘How lucky I chose this one—I hesitated
between the one with the black pin-spot and
the plain white one—and how lucky it still looks
new.”</p>

<p>“That reminds me of my new puce stockings,”
said Melsie Ponting. “Do you know that no less
than three gentlemen acquaintances—old beaux of
mine, you know—stopped me on Geary to say how
cute they looked. Don’t you want to say something
about my puce stockings, Banner?”</p>

<p>Emily whispered incautiously to Edward, “I
think she even sleeps with mistletoe over her bed.”</p>

<p>Edward was strongly stroking the dog’s head.
“The point of a dog,” he said, “is that you can
always pretend to yourself that the dog is saying to
itself, ‘Well say, this is a feller worth knowing.’
They always look like that. No dog ever will show
that he despises you.”</p>

<p>“Edward,” said Emily, “are your spirits always
at half mast?”</p>

<p>Edward had an acute pain in his head, under his
eyebrow. But his mind seemed to him detached<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
from the pain and extraordinarily facile. He could
hear well, he felt, but this was because Banner Hope
was singing in such a sharp voice. Edward said,
“It is more dramatic to be sad than to be happy,
anyway, Emily. Everything that is meant to be
dramatic is sad. The song that Hope is singing is—like
all jazz songs—about being far away from
where you want to be.”</p>

<p>“Sadness is too easy,” said Emily. “It is like
mother-love and the weakness of little children and
the old home and the maiden’s prayer—a too easy
short cut to drama. All my life I have been dramatic
but I have never arrived at drama by sadness.”</p>

<p>There seemed to be things rolling about under
Edward’s forehead. He thought they were loaded
dice; they did not feel like balls, they hurt too much
and had too many corners. He was almost pleased
when he tried to stand and found himself too giddy.</p>

<p>Edward realised for the first time that it was
raining outside. There were miles of air full of
rain, like steel bars between him and safe towns and
a warm bed.</p>

<p>“Gee!” exclaimed Melsie, unremittingly facetious.
“Edward’s British standards have fallen
down on him. One twist too many in the lemon
peel, Mr. Williams.”</p>

<p>But Rhoda saw his eyes and rose with that tolerant
yet exasperated look to which Edward was
accustomed when he needed sympathy. There was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
wild agony in his forehead. He fell down. He
rolled upon one side and then on the other. For a
second he saw Emily looking detached, looking at
him with an expression of excited contempt. Was
she saying, “Oh, what a party!” to herself? Rhoda
pressed her hands firmly over his eyes, her cold
hands moved firmly about his forehead....</p>

<p>Edward was not good at bearing pain although
he was fairly well accustomed to the exercise. It
was only after disgracing himself in his own eyes
and in Emily’s several times by crying in the car
that he found himself in a ward in a San Francisco
hospital.</p>

<p>It was immediately apparent that he could not
escape an operation. The surgeon tapped his forehead
impressively and his gold teeth gleamed briskly
down upon the horizontal Edward.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t carry those sinuses about with me,
my friend, not in that condition, not for half of John
D. Rockefeller’s pile.”</p>

<p>Edward would not have minded continuing to
carry his sinuses about exactly as they were. He
vaguely treasured his afflictions. Without them he
would not have felt interesting. Once, when a palmist
told him that the latter part of his life would be
spent in perfect health, Edward was definitely disappointed.
However, an operation had its dramatic
side, at least in anticipation and in retrospect. At
the time it was a humiliation and a terror.</p>

<p>“General anæsthetic absolutely unnecessary,” the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
gold-mouthed surgeon had said. “It’s as simple as
letting off a gun. I’ll take out your tonsils at the
same time. You won’t know a thing about it.
You’ll be out batting with your friends in three
days.”</p>

<p>Early one morning a man in white helped the
pale Edward on to a white-sheeted vehicle which
ran quickly on white and furtive castors. There
was no pillow on the vehicle, and Edward, perfectly
horizontal, darting head first along strange smelling
corridors, felt like a torpedo whizzing towards destruction.
“As simple as letting off a gun.”</p>

<p>The surgeon, waiting in a sort of loose-box furnished
in white, was dressed in white. His manner
had lost the affability which had hitherto characterised
it. Even his gold teeth were hidden by a white
mask which, like the mask of a Turkish woman, hid
the lower part of his face. He further obscured
his face by covering one eye with a saucer made of
mirror. The pupil of his eye could be seen through
a hole in the middle of the saucer, restless and malevolent
like a spider in its web. Edward was draped
in gauze by a nurse. The smell of drugs and disinfectants
was so strong that it seemed as if the walls
must burst.</p>

<p>There was now no escaping from what the surgeon
was going to do. The only thing one could do
was to hinder him in his work.</p>

<p>“Keep still, keep still ...” said the surgeon in a
harsh voice. “Stop that noise, you fool.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span></p>

<p>Edward was afraid and he intended to stop the
noise but he heard his own voice still bursting from
his lungs. “Ah-ow ... ah-ow....”</p>

<p>He wished to implore the surgeon to stop and let
him rest from pain and the feeling of ubiquitous
blood, but the cocaine in his throat prevented him
from articulating. Every time the surgeon struck his
terrible little chisel, Edward winced violently. He
was very anxious that the surgeon should realise
how unusually sensitive he was. He wanted the
surgeon to be sorry for him. But the surgeon was
angry. He tapped Edward’s forehead with barely
suppressed anger. “I’m within a third of an inch
of your brain here,” he said. “It’s up to you
whether I can put this bit of work through or not.”</p>

<p>Edward writhed. The nurse took his hand.
“She’s sorry,” thought Edward.</p>

<p>There was blood everywhere. Some blood on the
white apron that was stretched across the surgeon’s
stomach. Sweat was falling from the surgeon’s
chin.</p>

<p>“Take him away,” said the surgeon suddenly and
loudly. It was over. Full of shame because of his
forlorn and hideous condition, Edward was wheeled
quickly along the corridors. A man on crutches in
a check woollen dressing-gown stared at his outraged
and disordered face. Edward made feeble
movements with his hands and the nurse covered
his face with part of the sheet. “Now people will
think I am dead. They will get quite a thrill,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
thought Edward and lay very still. When they took
the sheet away he was beside his bed in the long
bleak ward. All the other patients were looking
greedily at him. Edward wanted to tell the nurse
of his horror and discomfort but the cocaine still
blocked his utterance. He could not mould his voice
into syllables.</p>

<p>He hoped intensely that Emily would not come to
see him while he was padded with bloodstained
cotton-wool. He made up little tests to find out
whether she would come. “If the sunlight reaches
the chin of the man opposite before a tram goes by
outside I shall know that she will not come until I
am really fit to let her see me.”</p>

<p>In answer to a croak from the man opposite, the
nurse came and pulled the blind down with a peevish
flounce. Most of the nurses in that ward visited
on everyone who made a request the irritation they
had accumulated by reason of scores of other requests.
If Edward asked for anything he was made
to feel as if he had asked for the same thing an
unreasonable number of times. Only when the doctors
were there the nurses spoke in soft optimistic
voices and patted the patients’ shoulders genially
and called them “This poor boy....”</p>

<p>Edward’s test was spoilt by the pulling down of
the blind. He betted with himself on whether the
facetious man with bristly hair would ring the bell
for the nurse before the blind man next to him did
so. The facetious man called the nurses, “Say, Saddie,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
and asked them about their beaux. No nurse
was ever irritable with him. Sometimes he rang the
bell specially to tell the nurse that he was so hollow
he could put himself outside a whole steer, and the
nurses, though they gave him nothing, never seemed
to be annoyed by his cheerful importunity.</p>

<p>Edward thought that no-one in the world cared
that he was ill. He did not want Emily to come
and see him in his undignified condition. But he
would have liked her to come to the door of the
ward with a great splendid tangle of salmon-colored
roses and be stopped there by a grave sweetfaced
nurse, who would tell her that Mr. Williams was too
seriously ill to see anyone. Then Emily would ask,
“Is there any danger?” in an anxious voice that he
had never heard, and the nurse would shake her
grave sweet head and say, “One never knows. He is
suffering terribly. The surgeon had to operate
within a third of an inch of his brain.” Edward fell
into a half sleep imagining the roses that Emily
would bring and lay against his lips.</p>

<p>When he awoke he saw Banner Hope walking
away from him towards the door of the ward.</p>

<p>“Hey!” said Edward in a thick desperate voice.
A week before he would have refused to believe
that the sight of Banner Hope could ever give him
pleasure.</p>

<p>“Why, why, why....” said Mr. Hope, turning
round guiltily. Edward saw at once that the visitor
had been glad to find the patient asleep. It had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
been to Mr. Hope an opportunity to acquire merit
as a benevolent friend without the effort of expressing
benevolence. “Why, why, why ... isn’t this
just too bad?...”</p>

<p>He looked inquisitively at Edward’s miserable
face.</p>

<p>“Now, don’t you say a thing, Edward. The nurse
has told me how it is. You gotter lie low and say
nothing and I’ll give you noos of all the folks. All
your friends surely are peeved with these old sawbones
for carving you about this way. I should
say so. Yes, indeed.”</p>

<p>This unprecedented burst of sympathy at once
restored to Edward a pale gleam of the melancholy
heroic light in which it was his constant effort to
see himself. Still the name of Emily had not yet
been mentioned and he tried to point this out. But
his throat still played him false.</p>

<p>“Eb-gy....”</p>

<p>“That’s all right. That’s all right. I get you
perfectly. You gotter let uncle do all the tongue
work. Let me see now.... Well, there’s Melsie
Stone Ponting. She’s a sport now.... What
d’you guess she said when she knew you were sick?
Why, she said—well, mebbe I’d better not tell you
after all.... Anyway it was very smart and
showed how crazy she was about you. Avery Bird
I haven’t seen recently, he naturally can’t think of
a thing except Rhoda’s indictment. I guess you’ve
heard how Rhoda was arrested the day we all got<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
home from Yosemite. Indicted for what they call
Criminal Syndicalism. Some of the dope she put
across at the W. I. L. A. kinda got somebody’s
goat. You know, when we’d left you at the hospital
some of us went round for a drink at Rhoda’s studio.
There’s a kind of an old she-janitor, you know,
located in the basement, and she met us and said how
the cops had been and opened Rhoda’s bureau and
gotten a wad of papers out of it. Rhoda surely
was mad, and Avery—who almost never lets up on
his detached pose or says anything except epigrams—I’ll
say he blasphemed quite a bit. And right
there in the middle of that little tableau two plain-clothes
cops walked in. The door was still open
and they walked in and there was Rhoda up to her
elbows in her bureau, trying to find out which papers
they’d gotten hold of. Well, it was a fair cinch.
There was no getting around it. One of the cops
read the warrant; it was all about sabbotidge and
advocating unlawful methods of effecting political
changes. They seemed to know a whole heap about
sister Rhoda. She didn’t answer back any. She
smiled and looked white. Avery said a hell of a
lot, but they didn’t take much account of him. They
took all our names and addresses. Of course, it’s
a long ways from indictment to conviction. Avery
says he’s not taking much on her chances, she’s got
in good and deep. The ‘What Is Liberty’ offered to
put up her bail money—but Rhoda’s got plenty of
dough herself. For some reason she isn’t accepting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
bail. It seems like if she’s got to be arrested she
wants to have it done thorough. She’s always been
crazy about prisoners and jails....”</p>

<p>“Ebb-ly ...” hiccoughed Edward.</p>

<p>The nurse was beckoning to Banner. The sedate
wives and mothers of other patients followed by
their scrubbed and creaking children were willingly
submitting to authority and leaving the ward.</p>

<p>“Say, I must be moving along,” said Banner Hope
with alacrity. “What’s that you say? Emily? Oh,
Emily’s gone to China. Take care of yourself,
Edward, some of your friends’ll be around again
some time soon....”</p>

<p>Edward was left in such an unrelieved condition
of depression that he was on the verge of peace.
“Gone to China.... Gone to China.... Gone
to China....” his mind chanted to itself to the
rhythm of the pulse drumming in his ears. He
reminded himself without ceasing that Emily had
gone to China. To do so put the finishing touch to
his orgy of despair. But all the time he felt certain
that his ears had really played him false. All the
time a little secret unadmitted factory in his mind
was circulating hope by making phrases with similar
vowel sounds. “He must have said, ‘Emily’s doing
fine,’ or he must have said, ‘Emily’s reading Heine,’
or he must have said, ‘Emily—how do <em>I</em> know?’”
The rhymes became less and less probable as Edward
approached sleep. “Penny-a-liner.... Asia
Minor.... Clementina.... Norah Criner....”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
But gone to China seemed the most absurd of
all.</p>

<p>Edward was long enough in this hospital to fit a
kind of bare innocent interlude into his experience.
No other visitor came to see him during the three
weeks of his illness, and he had leisure to build upon
the dark and sordid foundation of his life a sort of
airy trivial superstructure of interests. He watched
the manners of the nurses. He became interested in
human temperatures, weights, symptoms and facetious
gossip connected with physical details. The
watch under his pillow became his most intimate
friend and guide. Waking up at six o’clock, bathing,
and bed-making were an intolerable nuisance, but
he was much concerned if the nurses were a moment
late. The whole day was enlivened by the jokes or
scoldings of the nurses. A new joke was hardly ever
made in the ward, but the old ones were always successful.
All the men laughed at them because they
were glad that the temper of the nurses made joking
possible. Sometimes the doctors were late and,
though no-one loved the doctors, everyone was exasperated
with them for being late. Sometimes the
doctors were so late that the breakfasts became tired
of waiting, and then all the patients ate their breakfasts
with a sense of incompleteness and danger.
Meals were very important. Sometimes there were
little red jellies at the midday meal, and when the
cheerful glitter of these jellies blossomed on all the
approaching trays Edward was full of an almost gay<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
anticipation. There were no books to read, only
magazines. To the nurses a magazine was a book.
Any magazine would do. One did not mention the
titles of books or magazines in the ward; one asked
for “a book to read” as one would ask for a glass
of milk. Edward was called by doctors and nurses
“a great student” because he was always reading a
magazine. He was not critical enough to refuse
to read the bad literature that was placed before
him. Sometimes he quite enjoyed the sentimental
love stories. He read the comic pages with a somber
interest. And he often made little tunes in his
head to fit the poems, most of which seemed to have
been written in imitation of each other. Some of the
poems were patriotic and these annoyed Edward; it
seemed so silly that anyone should love any country
but England to the point of writing bad rhymes in its
honor. Edward’s mind was tired, too tired to feel
very acutely the need of better fare. Others in the
ward were more conscious than he. The man next
to Edward liked the works of Gene Stratton Porter;
he thought the tales of this writer very moral and
very deep. He often told their plots in great detail
to Edward, announcing himself as “considerable of
a student like yourself.” This man, who had a thin
voice all on one note, was fond of talking to his
neighbors at night. He would say, “Hope I’m not
disturbing you folks,” and nobody dared to say,
“You are.” They were all rather gentlemanly and
talked a good deal about Americanism and the advantages<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
of American education. In health they
frequented movies rather than saloons. They all
had wives or very respectable sweethearts who came
conscientiously to sit with them during visiting hours.
You could distinguish the sweethearts from the wives
by their habit of bringing tight bundles of flowers
and flinging them down ungraciously on the stomachs
of the afflicted. Wives never did this. The wives
brought snorting and bubbling babies instead of
flowers. Neither wives nor sweethearts had anything
much to say. They all looked as if they took
for granted that the invalids were going to die.
Visiting the sick seemed to embarrass them hopelessly.</p>

<p>Visiting hours were always exciting to Edward
because Emily might come. He still boasted to himself
that she had gone to China and that he was sunk
in despair, but actually he felt convinced that he had
mistaken Banner Hope’s meaning. When he should
next see her he would tell her of his mistake as a
sort of heroically tragic joke. She would come any
day now and sit beside his bed and tears would come
into his eyes and his thin hand would grope for hers
and for a moment they would both be unable to
speak. Then he would say simply, “They told me
you had gone.” And she would think, “Could I
ever find a more faithful lover than this?” and she
would touch his hot thin cheek with her cold fingers.</p>

<p>He hated the nights. Either he would stay awake
and watch the dim sickly light upon the ceiling and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
think of his dreary yet too expensive room at the
hotel absorbing money all this time, and think of
the senseless and exasperating death of Jimmy at
Loos, and think of money again and of the fact
that he could not get his complexion clear—directly
one set of spots healed another began. Or else he
would sleep and dream cruelly and grotesquely of
endless, arid journeys and of beautiful anticipations
that withered away and of missing trains—never of
Emily.</p>

<p>In the daytime he would forget the hateful night.
All day till about six, when the night clamored to be
remembered, he was almost contented.</p>

</div>

<p>To emerge from this mild life was like falling
into the sea from a safe deck. Edward found himself
suddenly in his dark viewless room at the hotel.
He could not find anyone who could tell him where
Emily was. He could hardly walk. The ground
seemed strangely near when he walked. He managed
to go to Rhoda’s studio. It was empty. The
janitor could only say with some pride, “Mrs. Bird
has gotten herself jailed....”</p>

<p>Nothing seemed left to Edward but San Francisco
itself. Nothing was left that he could grasp; his
personal hold on the happy city had disappeared.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
He felt as if he held a cold hard diamond in his
hand. A diamond on the palm of the hand has no
value, no value until another hand touches it or eyes
desire it, or until it is set in a crown.</p>

<p>All his days Edward sat alone with an aching
head either in his room or in the lobby of the hotel.
In the lobby he sat in the midst of overdressed
painted women waiting for their beaux. They were
all hostile to him and to one another. In revenge
he dwelt on the fact that their hair, waved and
padded under light nets, looked like wigs and that,
though they looked angrily at one another, they all
tried to look alike. Sometimes one of them would
have an “adventure”; a strange stray beau would
find a pretext to get into conversation and they
would talk impertinently and with heavy facetiousness
for a time.</p>

<p>Edward sat morbidly rejoicing that he was as
much different from them as it was possible to be.
He even valued the pain in his head because it set
him apart from them.</p>

<p>One day a familiar face among the waiting women
occurred like one of the dreams that he could not
believe in. It was Mrs. Melsie Ponting but Edward
ran to her like a lover. She quite obviously regretted
his appearance; obviously she did not wish him to
know whom she intended to meet there. She
enjoyed the excitement of concealing something.
She had a rendezvous with the medical student,
Pike, whose face Edward had neither liked nor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
committed to memory. The danger of discovery
by Edward, therefore, was very slight, but Mrs.
Ponting fortunately did not know this. She loved
petty danger connected with petty love. The excitement
made her eyes look almost as large as they
were painted.</p>

<p>Edward leaned towards her eagerly and asked her
for news of all his friends except Emily.</p>

<p>“My dear, isn’t it exciting about Rhoda!” chattered
Melsie. “I’m perfectly sure she’ll get the
maximum sentence. She’s so high and mighty she
doesn’t have any of the artifices that you and me
would probably get away with. She won’t even
come out of jail on bail. Avery Bird is mad. Everybody
wants to find Avery to ask him for news, but
he’s like a spook—you never find him unless you’re
not looking for him, and then you see him speeding
in a taxi down Van Ness towards the Hall of Justice.
My dear, I must tell you a joke on Banner
Hope—you know he is located in Oakland, but he
doesn’t like to have us know it—who would? Banner
vamped a flapper at Jove Pinelli’s and took her—where
d’you think?—to Rhoda’s empty studio.
This is how he squared the janitor——”</p>

<p>“Melsie, tell me, where is Emily?”</p>

<p>Melsie was affronted. She was glad that she had
something to say that would hurt Edward.</p>

<p>“Emily? Oh, Emily’s gone to China.”</p>

<p>Edward was at once very angry. He was so
angry that there was a swollen feeling below his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
ears. It was outrageous that mention of the innocent
and lovely name of Emily should produce nothing
but this shocking parrot cry—“Emily? Oh,
Emily’s gone to China....” Why was this conspiracy
directed against him? Emily would not
wish it. Emily would wish gentle and exciting things
to be said of her.... “Emily is here—on her way
to see you....” “Emily is gathering poppies for
you in the fields behind Alameda....” “Emily
would never go far from you, Edward....”</p>

<p>“No, she is shameless. That is the message she
meant to leave for me. ‘Emily? Oh, Emily’s gone
to China.’”</p>

<p>“Yes, sirree—bob, she’s gone to China,” repeated
Melsie. “Furthermore, Edward, she’s taken my
kiddie with her. It was a bully chance for me, since
you were such a piker. They’re all touring the
Orient together—she and my honey and Mr. and
Mrs. McTab.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ponting lived entirely from her own point
of view. This was her life, to charm those whom
she needed, to wound those who rebuffed her, to
ignore those with whom she was not acquainted.
Her imagination was completely blind and deaf;
wounds or joys outside of herself were inconceivable
to her. She was glad of her present advantage
over Edward, the advantage of the wounder over
the wounded. There was nothing deliberate in her
gladness; simply she did not know pain unless she
felt it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span></p>

<p>Edward had very little money. His operation
and the hospital had absorbed almost all that he
had. He owed the rest—and more—to his hotel.
He had no shame about accepting money. He lacked
manly pride. If Melsie Ponting had offered him
money he would have taken it gladly. He would
have pretended to himself that it was a great struggle
and a great humiliation to accept money but
really he would have been delighted. He had never
had any understanding of money, no apprehension
of poverty, no skill in keeping money, no anticipation
of increasing it. The etiquette and decencies
of money made no appeal to him. It is hardly
necessary to add that Mrs. Ponting did not offer
him money, even when she had asked him, “Well,
for goodness’ sake, Edward, why don’t you go to
the Orient too as you planned?” and Edward had
replied, “I haven’t any money.”</p>

<p>One thing Edward was not too proud but too shy
to do. He could not actually ask for money. San
Francisco is full of generous people; almost any of
the guests at his party would have helped him. But
he did not know how he would introduce the subject.
There was no equality of friendship where
Edward was concerned.</p>

<p>Rhoda Romero had offered to pay him to go to
China. “Did she know Emily was going? No, she
wanted to get rid of me. I am a weariness to
Rhoda. She was trying to mislay me kindly. And
now I have mislaid Emily.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span></p>

<p>Every day for a week after that Edward walked
about on Van Ness Avenue in the hope of seeing
Avery Bird speeding past in a taxi. Edward thought
he would throw himself in front of the taxi. For the
first time Avery Bird, now in trouble himself, would
look gently on Edward. Van Ness Avenue is the
Bond Street of motor cars. I have no doubt that
little homely Fords, bragging in the public garages
at night, talk about the latest fashions in windshields
on Van Ness. Van Ness also leads to the
Hall of Justice. Edward moved from window to
window examining the shining new automobiles and
constantly turning sharply, expecting to see Rhoda,
restored to freedom, coming to meet him.</p>

<p>Once he went to the Hall of Justice to ask if he
might speak to Rhoda. His appearance seemed
to irritate the public servants whom he addressed.
They offered him no assistance. He wrote a long
and introspective letter to Rhoda, care of the City
Jail, but he received no answer.</p>

<p>He was a little stronger in health and felt capable
of filling almost any position except those which
were advertised in the papers. Finally he was
obliged to apply for a job as salesman for a patent
egg-beater. But he was told that he lacked punch.
He became desperate and attempted to become a
grocer’s assistant in a poor part of the city. The
boss, a bustling Greek, said he didn’t want no white-collar
guys. Then Edward called at the office of a
company that seemed inexplicably anxious that young<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
America should become acquainted with the works
of Milton. To this end they had printed a <cite>Milton
for Our Boys</cite>. It was not, of course, “in poetry.”
Poetry is unhealthy for children, unmanly for Our
Boys. On the contrary, this was Milton’s genius
made clear for immature minds, as the Jewish,
violet-powdered young lady in the office cleverly
recited by heart to Edward. The advertisement had
demanded the services of highminded young men
and women of college education interested in public
service, so Edward rightly felt that his tendency to
white-collarism would be no disadvantage here. A
college education, it appeared, was, in most cases,
necessary to enable the public-spirited young men
and women to persuade the hardfisted mothers of
Our Boys not only to pay one dollar down and procure
a five dollar <cite>Paradise Lost</cite> in their homes, but
in addition, to sign a form ordering four more
works of Milton—<cite>Paradise Regained for Our Boys</cite>,
<cite>Collected Works of Milton for Our Boys One</cite>, <cite>Collected
Works of Milton for Our Boys Two</cite> and
<cite>Milton and America</cite> by Spilwell G. Mundt. Any
enlightened mother who should commit herself to
the purchase of the whole series would be presented,
absolutely free, with a beautiful picture of George
Washington standing under the Stars and Stripes
looking flushed and repressed as though he were
suffering from indigestion. It was probably felt by
the firm that this gift would gloss over the fact that,
unfortunately, the immortal writer to be introduced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
to Our Boys was not, strictly speaking, a hundred
per cent American.</p>

<p>The fact that Edward was English appealed to
the Jewish young lady in charge as rather piquant.
It seemed to her that his speech—though, of course,
ridiculously foreign—was somehow “cultured.” She
therefore waived the fact that he could not claim
a college education. She gave him a little pamphlet
showing him what to say to the mothers of North
Berkeley. The pamphlet opened with advice about
persistence—never get discouraged—go right on
ringing till somebody comes—if possible step inside
the door as soon as it is opened—be cheery and sympathetic—never
take the first No for an answer,
nor the second either; many firstrate deals have been
put through after two or three refusals—remember
it’s mother’s job to grip the pocketbook tight, but—well,
she’s only a woman after all, and doesn’t she
want to see that little scamp of hers grow up into a
big, wise, cultured woman? The opening sentence of
the attack was, “Say, Mother, what are you doing
for your boy?” But a few comments on the
weather or the view—any cheery topic that presented
itself—to be inserted before that opening
sentence, were in order. Edward would receive ten
per cent commission—fifty cents for each work of
Milton sold. “Some of our men make five to seven
dollars a day,” said the young lady in an inspiring
voice. “And North Berkeley’s a clean
field....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span></p>

<p>On asking what a clean field meant, Edward was
told that—so far as the Company knew—no other
highminded young men or women had tried to
induce the mothers of North Berkeley to buy Milton.
Edward was glad of this. He could imagine
that a busy mother called repeatedly to the door
to show reason why she should not buy Milton for
her boy would in time become difficult to deal
with.</p>

<p>Five dollars a day was thirty dollars a week.
He could live on two dollars a day and save half
his earnings. On a hundred and fifty dollars he
thought he could get to China. He could save a
hundred and fifty dollars in ten weeks.</p>

<p>He was not often so full of hope.</p>

<p>First he went out with another public-spirited
young man by whose skill he was supposed to learn
and benefit. This young man had facetious and
astonished eyes, a fat, ingrowing nose, and tight
high-waisted clothes which proved him to have had
the Western equivalent of a college education.</p>

<p>Edward was much impressed by his methods. The
first house they invaded was a lonely eccentric house
crouching behind a thin mask of young eucalyptus
trees. In the garden a Japanese was working, and
from him Edward’s instructor ascertained that the
mistress of the house was not at home and that even
if she had been at home she would have been found
to be childless. Undaunted by this, the instructor,
followed by the surprised Edward, ran towards the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
house holding out eager hands towards a female
“help” who was shaking a mat out of the garden
door.</p>

<p>“Has she gone? Have I missed her?” wailed the
instructor in a poignant voice.</p>

<p>“Do you mean Mrs. Watson?” asked the credulous
help sympathetically. “Yes.... Why, isn’t
that just too bad! She went out on a errand. She’ll
be right back, I guess. Don’t you want to come in
and wait?”</p>

<p>“I’ll say I do,” said the instructor, rubbing his
hands together and hissing inwards through his
teeth in the manner of a real family friend. He
went into the living room. “Gee, it’s good to be
here again.”</p>

<p>The reply of the admiring help was an offer of
drinks for him and Edward.</p>

<p>With a glass of light beer in his hand the instructor
walked about looking at the books on the
shelves. “Kipling ... Lawrence ... Hergesheimer ...
Hardy ... aw shucks! Say, ma’am,
you interested in classical litera<em>ture</em>?”</p>

<p>Edward, who hated beer, was not happy. The
situation seemed to him only evanescently comfortable.
Besides, the opening—Say mother, what are
you doing for your boy?—was plainly ruled out
here.</p>

<p>“I’ll say I am,” replied the help. “That is to
say—I’m not one of these highbrows, but I get a
lot of kick out of a good tale.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span></p>

<p>“You’ve read all the British classics of course,”
continued the instructor. “Say listen, you know it’s
a fact that although these Britishers neglect their
teeth and don’t know the first thing about sanitation
or democracy, their classic authors do surely deliver
the goods. Some guys is so darn narrowminded
they could pretty near meet their ears at the back
of their heads, but I say hand over credit where
credit is due. You know any of the dope by this
guy they call John Milton?”</p>

<p>“Does he write for the movies?”</p>

<p>“May have done, for all me,” replied the instructor
cautiously. “Anyway, he’s dead now. But his
tales certainly are red-meat tales. I’ll ask you to
give these books the once over—John Milton put
into good peppy American prose and il<em>lust</em>rated by
one of the swellest artists in Kansas city.”</p>

<p>The help at last became suspicious. “What you
carrying those books around for?” she asked. “You
one of these fresh agent nuts? I thought you said
you was a friend of Mrs. Watson.”</p>

<p>“I’m a friend of everyone that’s got a taste for
classical litera<em>ture</em>,” replied the instructor courageously.
“I’m a public benefactor. I tell you I’m
ready to put into your hands this minute this illustrated
Milton Dee Lux for one dollar down. It’s a
unique opportunity——”</p>

<p>“Now you can just quit right away,” shouted the
help, snatching up her O-Cedar mop with a threatening
gesture. “You got no business to of came.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
Ef Mrs. Winton S. Watson was to come into this
room and find a coupla two-cent drummers drinking
her beer—well, good-night. No, I won’t hear another
word, you can just get busy moving, the
quicker the better.”</p>

<p>Edward led the retreat. The instructor made a
heroic stand and Edward, trembling in the garden,
heard a sort of duet proceeding from the living
room for a few seconds. Then the instructor, humming
brazenly, joined him.</p>

<p>“That dame certainly was a goatgetter,” he admitted.
“These folks is fifty fifty. Sometimes they
fall for dope like that most before you begin putting
it over. Sometimes they don’t, that’s all there is to
it. It’s fifty fifty.”</p>

<p>Mathematically speaking he was wrong. The
percentage of weak housewives willing to invest
money in the Classics was nothing like fifty per cent.
Yet the general result of the day was not discouraging
to Edward. He looked back with a certain
excitement to a day spent climbing up steep
geranium-bordered steps to inexplicably friendly
interviews. He looked forward still to making five
dollars a day and refused to analyse, even to himself,
the differences of manner between himself and
his instructor.</p>

<p>Next day he was allowed to go by himself.</p>

<p>He studied North Berkeley on the map like a
lover studying the portrait of his mistress. He
decided to begin work at a street the name of which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
reminded him, without reason, of Emily. He made
the stopping of the street-car a secret test of the
coming day’s chance of success. If it should stop
at his corner for passengers other than himself it
would mean success—five dollars—perhaps a record—ten
dollars.... A group of women stopped the
car at his corner and he was very glad until, on
calling at the first two houses, he found that the
group had consisted of potential clients of Milton,
departing for their marketing. At the third house
the housewife was in. Edward did not begin with,
“Say, mother, what are you doing for your boy?”
He lost his head.</p>

<p>He began lamentably, “I say, I’ve got a book here
to sell.”</p>

<p>The mistress of the house shook her head sadly
at him. “I dare say you have, but I haven’t the
money to spend.”</p>

<p>“Oh, sorry ...” said Edward and turned
towards the street again.</p>

<p>“Wait a moment. I believe you’re English. I
am English too—a remittance woman. How rash
of you to take up salesman’s work in a country of
salesmen. Would you like to come in?”</p>

<p>“I have my methods and the instructor had his,”
thought Edward complacently as he followed her in.
“The results seem to be the same.”</p>

<p>He looked with cool hope at the “remittance
woman.” She had rather a flat crumpled face and
very soft looking matt skin. Her pince-nez were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
the only firm thing in her face; they obviously
pinched very strongly.</p>

<p>“I must introduce you to my only friend,” she
said waving her hands towards an apparently empty
corner of the living-room. Then Edward saw that
a canary was suspiciously eyeing him from the
dresser.</p>

<p>Edward chuckled doubtfully. “Have you really
no other friends?” he said, telling himself that the
woman was rather morbid.</p>

<p>“None,” replied the Englishwoman placidly.
“The people I know in England pay me to make
my home on another continent. I am unfortunate
in being hateful to everyone I meet.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t you any relations?” asked Edward
lamely.</p>

<p>“I am not married and my sisters in England hate
me. I once was determined to get married and even
got so far as to wait in a white dress at a church
in North London. But the man changed his mind
and never came. Indeed he did not change his
mind, he hated me all along. Everybody does.”</p>

<p>Edward was overwhelmed. The woman seemed
to him offensive. Did she suppose she was the only
person in the world who had Known Grief? However,
he felt a little proud because she was telling him
these things. He thought he must have a sympathetic
face—“the face of one who had been down
into the depths.” He drew the corners of his mouth
down to make his face more sympathetic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span></p>

<p>“When I say everybody,” added the woman, “of
course I am excepting Edward.”</p>

<p>Edward dropped his sympathetic expression just
as it was properly adjusted. “Excepting who?”</p>

<p>She waved her hand again towards the canary,
which flew across on to her shoulder. “Edward,”
she explained. “He loves me. He loves my hair
and my lips. He pecks and pulls at my hair in the
mornings when I let him out of his cage. I lie in
bed late—I have nothing to get up for— And
Edward holds my chin between his nervous little
claws and pushes his beak between my lips....”</p>

<p>Edward Williams looked with dislike at her hair
and her lips. Her hair was grey and had a middle-aged,
tangled curl in it. Her lips were dry and
rather grey too.</p>

<p>“My name is Edward too,” he said.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the remittance woman, pleased.
“Isn’t that a nice stroke of chance? Tell me about
yourself. Why are you attempting an unlikely job
like this?”</p>

<p>Edward at once felt pity in the air. He groped
for pity instinctively. He told her in a plaintive
voice about his loneliness, the fact that he had no
mother and that Jimmy was killed at Loos, he told
her of his efforts to support himself, of his love for
Emily....</p>

<p>When he had finished he felt only slightly guilty
and looked down at the book he wished her to buy.
She did not want it but surely she could afford to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
buy something she did not want from a kindred
soul. He would refuse at first her offer to buy his
book, he thought.</p>

<p>“We are rather alike,” she said. “We neither of
us get on with the world.”</p>

<p>Her voice was almost jealous. She so rarely met
competition in her line.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Edward. “But you are more fortunate
than I, if you are hated. I am ignored, which
is much worse.”</p>

<p>She assented doubtfully. “Certainly everybody
hates me,” she insisted. It was her one vanity and
her support.</p>

<p>There was a pause and they looked at each other
with dislike.</p>

<p>“I don’t need your book,” she said. “But I have
five dollars to spare. I suppose you are insulted
now. You can put the five dollars in your pocket
and spare me the trouble of breaking the back of
my bookshelf with such a straw as <cite>Milton for Boys</cite>.
Take it and hate me for it if you like. I am used
to that.”</p>

<p>Edward held the flaccid money in his hand. He
thought, “It pays to be pathetic.” He despised himself
at the same time and thought, “Even Banner
Hope would be shocked at this. Why haven’t I
automatically evolved a proud personality like everyone
else?”</p>

<p>She opened the door by way of dismissing him.
“You will curse me whenever you think of this,” she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
said. “It will be a satisfaction to you. People
always curse those who pity them.”</p>

<p>“I shan’t,” said Edward, putting the five dollar
bill in his pocket. “I don’t believe anyone hates you
or curses you. You deceive yourself.”</p>

<p>When he looked back from the street her affronted
face was still turned towards him. With relief and
irritation he decided never to think of her again.</p>

<p>He sold no books either that day or the next.
He did not dare to use the provided formula—Say
mother—. He had nothing definite to use instead.
To one or two mothers who were too courteous to
slam the door he murmured broken suggestions
about the superiority of Milton to the movies. It
was a false step. The movies, to the American middle
class, are a substitute for religion. For uplift
the home depends on the movies. Edward found
himself guilty of blasphemy. Milton appeared in
the light of a criminal heresy.</p>

<p>After two days Edward went, like Noah’s homing
dove, to the office, Milton still in his beak.</p>

<p>“There’s something wrong with the district,” he
complained to the young lady there. “The word
book seems to mean nothing to them. All the
artistic words have changed their meaning in California.
<i>Book</i> means magazine, <i>Music</i> means jazz,
<i>Act</i> means behaving, <i>Picture</i> means a snapshot.
They haven’t even a place to keep books. They
have nothing but old <cite>Ladies’ Home Journals</cite> on
their dressers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span></p>

<p>Edward thought of <cite>Milton for Our Boys</cite> now as
a valuable but wronged book.</p>

<p>The young woman naturally did not pay much
attention to what he was saying. But she came from
Calistoga and was excited to meet so rare a specimen
as an educated foreigner. She was, in mind, face
and fashion, a typical young woman of the Wild
West. She had no interest or recreation whatever,
apart from flirtation. Englishmen were all nearly
lords in her democratic imagination. They were
therefore laughable but worth charming. She had
just mislaid her last steady beau so she was at the
moment a little susceptible. She had, temporarily,
no special man in mind when powdering her nose to
an amethyst color or corrugating her dark, dull, padded
hair.</p>

<p>“Why, isn’t that just too bad?” she said arching
her false looking eyebrows caressingly at Edward.
“Well, say, listen, don’t you want to try out Napa
County and Sonoma County? One of our men is
crazy to have us send someone there; he says there’s
a lot doing out that ways. My own home-city,
Calistoga, is some cultured burg, let me tell you.
My brother made fifteen dollars once in his vacation,
boosting the <cite>Saturday Evening Post</cite>. Say, I go
home sometimes over the week end. If you fix up
to work that locality, don’t you want to call in at
our place? I’d love to have you meet my Mom.”</p>

<p>She was planning to say to her Mom, “Say Mom,
I’ve got a new steady, an English lord.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span></p>

<p>“Are there azaleas in those parts? And does the
company pay one’s fare?” asked Edward.</p>

<p>The young lady looked uncomfortable and paused.
“Say Steve, I guess I would better put you wise on
something. This firm doesn’t do much of the faith,
hope and charity turn to folks in their country lines.
They only come across with your trolley fare on
commission—same as in Berkeley. No sales—no
cash. I don’t say I get much kick out of the way
they act, but there they are. But see here, my Pop’s
coming down to Berkeley to gimme a ride home next
Saturday in our old Dodge. Don’t you want to
come along? And when we get to our place,
brother’ll loan you his wheel, seeing you’re a friend
of mine. I’ve got a hunch, Steve, that you’re not
one of these way-up born-to-the-manner drummers.
Don’t you find it hard to impress strangers? I
thought so. Us up-and-coming Californians, you
know, you can’t get in with us without you’ve got a
lot of punch. Europeans don’t have any punch, the
way I figure it. Well, we can’t all be born where
we want, can we?”</p>

<p>Edward was pleased to have excited sympathy in
one more breast. “Our hero has that indefinable
<em>something</em> that only women’s subtler sensibilities can
appreciate....”</p>

<p>He persisted in his fruitless missionary efforts
among the mothers of North Berkeley until the
following Saturday. At a given time he proceeded
to a given rendezvous in Oakland to meet his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
patroness—whose name was Mame Weber—and
her Pop and her brother Cliff.</p>

<p>Cheek by jowl with Miss Weber he bounced upon
the back seat of Pop’s Dodge car. “Better if you’d
put your arm where it oughter be,” advised Miss
Weber, indicating her own ribs. “Only mind and
don’t get fresh. Pop’s awful strict. Say, got any
candies?”</p>

<p>Edward looked at her blankly.</p>

<p>“Not even a sticka gum? Why, I’ll say you’re a
nice beau. I’d a feller name of Al who couldn’t
never hardly hug me right away—his pockets was so
fulla candies. Say, Ed, you got a lot to learn.”</p>

<p>Edward accepted his rôle with surprise and pleasure.
Miss Weber was of the shrinking and protective
type when motoring and, whenever the car,
driven by rash brother Cliff, seemed unlikely to
avoid disaster, Edward enjoyed feeling against his
arm the stiffening and trembling of her thinly clothed
body.</p>

<p>“Emily doesn’t know me yet,” he thought. “She
has never let me show her my fine or strong side.”
Miss Weber took an insignificant but pleasing part
in the ranks of his sensations.</p>

<p>Napa Valley, like an inverted rainbow, lay before
him. The strange, creased, silken bodies of the hills
lay behind the glassy white veil of the air. The
shadows striped and varied them, and the night-green
patches of oaks, beaten almost as flat as the
shadows, were crammed into the canyons. On<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
every side, at a lower and more human level, a conventional
pattern of vineyards and steepled masses
of bleak eucalyptus trees was printed on the valley.
The orchards were alight with the bright golden
green that follows the blossom season and in their
shade the grass was passionately green.</p>

<p>As the car passed quickly the ends of the aisles
between the rows of delicate and jointed fruit-trees,
successive rays of violent green flashed along the
perspectives into Edward’s eyes. Blinking at this,
he hardly knew when first the mountain, Saint
Helena, parted the little near hills and inserted
between them its thickly blue peak.</p>

<p>“Hands praying ... or steeples ... or the
peaks of mountains,” thought Edward. “They are
all praising God always, whether there is a God or
not.”</p>

<p>The father of Miss Weber was a retail merchant
in Calistoga. He called his house not a house but a
“home.” “My Pop has one elegant home right in
the classy part of the city of Calistoga,” said Miss
Weber.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span></p>

<p>The American of the Weber type chooses many
of his words for their potential catch in the throat,
as it were. <i>Motherhood</i>, <i>manhood</i>, <i>lovelight</i>, <i>grip-o’-the-hand</i>,
the movies have made words of this kind
music in the American ear. But words with home
in them are the most popular—<i>homestead</i>, <i>homeland</i>,
<i>home-site</i>, <i>home-town</i>, <i>home-builder</i>.... We
who can live in houses and can see the word Mother
in print with dry eyes or hear the glugging of someone
else’s baby over its food in a cafeteria without
vicarious domestic ecstasy, must seem very coarse to
Americans. However, the missionary movies are
with us now. We shall all no doubt eventually suffer
a change of heart.</p>

<p>The Weber Home was made of wood, painted
mustard yellow picked out in sky blue. It had a
fancy roof and a jocose little castellated turret over
one window, like a drunkard’s hat on one side.</p>

<p>Mrs. Weber was not so classy as her son, her
daughter and her Home. She spent much of her
time in the kitchen and was at first realised by
Edward only as a shrill voice calling, “Walk right
in, Son, make yessell at home,” in reply to her
daughter’s announcement, “Oh, mom, meet my new
beau, Ed Williams.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Weber, when seen as well as heard, proved
to be extremely fat, though sprightly. She was
powdered just as lavishly as was her daughter, but
in a softer shade of mauve. She had fine dark
myopic eyes; her thick black brows met and dipped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
under the bridge of her pince-nez. Her bosom was
too enormous to seem even motherly. She had a
screaming laugh which was probably one of the
charms that had won her Mr. Weber and an elegant
home, for she laughed most assiduously during and
between jokes.</p>

<p>“Cheery ole dame is Mom, isn’t that right, Ed?”
said Miss Weber, throwing one of her pretty arms
half way round the vast shoulders of her Mom.</p>

<p>It was a simple home. Pop might well be proud
of it. He shewed, however, no signs of pride—no
signs, in fact, of anything. He did not speak more
than once or twice a day. Even at meals he sat half
turned from the table with musing eyes fixed on one
square of the carpet. He had a wrinkled thin neck
like a tortoise’s. His face was wrinkled and full of
grievances. He explored the inside of his cheeks
almost constantly with his tongue and sometimes
with his finger. Often he assisted his tongue and
finger by picking his teeth with any implement that
came handy. His one conversation with Edward
ran thus:</p>

<p>“Well, young feller, how much better d’you like
this country than yer own?”</p>

<p>“No better,” replied Edward nervously. He
hastened to add apologetically, “You see, I have an
affection for England because it’s my home—I mean
my homeland, as it were. Just the same as you’d
like America best even if you came to England——”</p>

<p>Mr. Weber laughed and set his toothpick to work<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
on rather an inaccessible tooth. “Reckon I shouldn’t
think anything of England,” he said in a final voice.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s what I mean,” said Edward, growing
rather red. “That’s rather what I feel about
America, when you compare it with England.”</p>

<p>Pop leaned forward and leveled his toothpick at
Edward’s face. “Now, see here, son,” he said,
showing only two of his left hand teeth.</p>

<p>Miss Weber shrieked, “Aw cut it out, Pop, and
you forget it too, Ed. Pop’s a reg’lar whizz at
politics.”</p>

<p>Young brother Cliff was a child of nature, a child,
as it were, of urban nature. He had no reticences,
it seemed to Edward, who was much afraid of him.
There was no telling what young brother Cliff
would say next. “’S’matter with Ed’s chin—’s’all
pimples?” he would say after a long rude silence.
Or, “Say Mom, Ed sweats at night same as Will
useter.” Edward slept in Cliff’s room during the
two nights of his visit. Young Cliff wore “Jazz
clothes”; they were very tight under the arms. It
seemed as if his clothes were made to be worn
with the elbows always up, on a desk or on a lunch
counter. They were very urban clothes. But Cliff
was much pleased with them. He had no country
clothes or country pursuits. He was frankly amused
at Edward’s English clothes. “Ed’s clothes fit him
like the shell of a peanut.” Cliff’s one Calistoga
amusement was to stand in front of the drug-store
while the Calistoga young women turned this way<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
and that as they preened themselves on the sidewalk
before him.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning Edward accompanied Cliff
on this exercise. After looking with rude intensity
at the figures and legs of all the young women in
sight, Cliff selected two—the two with the barest
necks and the largest imitation pearls—and offered
to buy them sodas. Edward and Cliff and the two
young women sat in a row on tall hinged stools
at the drug-store counter. Cliff hardly spoke one
word to the girls, though several times he jovially
kicked the shin of the nearest. Apart from this
he exchanged apparently amusing but incomprehensible
badinage with the soda-mixer behind the
counter. The girls powdered their noses and talked
in indifferent low voices to each other. They did not
seem to mind being excluded from manly conversation.
But twice Cliff turned to them and said—of
the ice cream soda—“Slips down easy, don’t it,
kid?” and then Edward was shocked at the instant
change of their expression to an obsequiously bright
admiring look.</p>

<p>“I thought there were more men than women in
California,” said Edward afterwards. “Why do
these girls cringe so, anyway before they’re married?”</p>

<p>Cliff did not give Edward much attention. “Never
too many beaux for these skirts,” he said. “Say,
Edward, did you see the way they was tickled to
death by your British pants?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span></p>

<p>Miss Weber was naturally more attentive to
Edward than were the others, but she was disappointed
in him. For three hours on a perfect Sunday
afternoon she sat on the couch close to Edward
in the stuffy living room, but Edward did not seem
to know what was expected of him. When Miss
Weber said, “Say, listen, Ed, tell me about the way
English girls act with their beaux.” Edward actually
began to do so. Usually so sensitive about the
impression he was making, he was quite complacent
now.</p>

<p>“This girl is really pathetically taken with me,”
he thought. He laid before her a description of a
day in Epping Forest, he produced an excerpt from
his childhood, he told her of a tree with enlarged
and tangled roots in which his lead soldiers used
to climb. Also he mentioned a young bat which he
and Jimmy had found. They made a hole for it in
the tree. It stayed two days.</p>

<p>“Jimmy was killed at Loos,” he said.</p>

<p>“Well, isn’t that too bad....” said Miss Weber.
She paused for a decent moment before saying,
“You’re a nice beau, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose you really think so,” said Edward,
smiling placidly. “You must have had many
more amusing beaux than me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my no,” replied Miss Weber acidly. She
threw her head back on the cushions so that her
round neck and line figure were seen to advantage.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
Edward redeemed himself a little by taking her hand
and feeling upward along her arm as if in curiosity.</p>

<p>“Rather a shame,” thought Edward happily, “to
raise her hopes like this.”</p>

<p>“You know, I have a true love already,” he said
aloud.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell the world you have,” replied Miss
Weber. “Haf-a-dozen, more like. In England I
guess.”</p>

<p>“In China.”</p>

<p>“Is that right? Well, China’s a long ways off,”
she said and placed her head a little doubtfully on
his shoulder.</p>

<p>“That’s nice,” said Edward, trying secretly to
pretend that the head was Emily’s. It was blasphemy,
for Miss Weber’s crimped hair looked
sticky under its dusty net. “Poor soul, poor defenceless
little woman....” he thought a little wearily.
He had never before had such advances from a virtuous
young woman, but he was already thinking of
himself as a heartbreaker. He was proud but he
ached for Emily.</p>

<p>“One’s life with such people is hideous,” he
thought suddenly. “People like me have to pretend
all the time with them. Pretend to be amused ...
to be grateful ... to be sprightly ... to be in
love. If one stopped pretending one would shout,
‘Oh, how hideous my life is when I am with you.’
Emily is easy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span></p>

<p>“I guess you haven’t gotten on to my first name,”
murmured Miss Weber.</p>

<p>“Yes I have. It’s Mame,” he replied with distaste.</p>

<p>Only once during his visit was Edward’s dramatic
sense aroused, and that was when he seemed to hear
Mom say to a silent and ghostlike neighbor who
had dropped in, “Merry, merry, merry were they,
and danced with their hair in a tremble.” After
studying the picture thus presented to his mental
retina, Edward realised that part of what she had
really said was, “It’s worry, worry, worry all day
about dancing ...”</p>

<p>That evening, when the energies of a cheap Victrola
had been directed to the delivery of a song
which one could tell was a comic song about Prohibition
because it was sung out of tune and with
a great deal of hiccoughing, Miss Weber asked her
brother for the loan of his bicycle.</p>

<p>“What’d I loan Ed my wheel for?” asked the
frank youth. “He’s not <em>my</em> beau, is he?”</p>

<p>“Why, Cliff, you know you haven’t used it yourself
in months. You’re not going to act mean, are
you?”</p>

<p>The discussion lasted for about seventy minutes.
It ended thus: “Why, what’d I wanter loan Ed my
wheel for? He’s not <em>my</em> beau. Mom, here’s Sis’
beau after my wheel. He’d skip with it, as likely
as not. It’s my wheel anyway.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, you won’t get any more music off<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
my Victrola. I’ll lock it up, you mean thing. Mom,
isn’t brother the mean thing?”</p>

<p>“Lock it up all you want. I can live without
music, I guess. I’m not one of your British highbrow
lords.”</p>

<p>Unperturbed, Mom read <cite>Mother’s Magazine</cite>,
her square florid face resting on its many chins like
a shut door at the top of steps. Mr. Weber picked
his teeth with clicking noises and looked at the floor
as though he could see through it.</p>

<p>When Edward awoke on Monday morning, Cliff
was gone. Miss Weber was knocking on the door.
“Brother says you can have his wheel,” she said
through the door. “I gotter catch my train in a
minute. Come down till I show you where the
wheel is.”</p>

<p>Edward felt for a moment sorry that his eyes
looked so ugly immediately after he awoke. “It’ll
disillusion her, poor soul,” he thought, putting on
his overcoat. “Perhaps it’s as well....”</p>

<p>“I’d better not borrow your brother’s bike, thanks
awfully. He didn’t seem really keen for me to
have it.”</p>

<p>“Shucks,” said Miss Weber guiltily. “He’s crazy
for you to have it. Nothing’ll happen. You can’t
eat it, can you? Come ahead.”</p>

<p>The last words he ever heard from Miss Weber
were spoken in the garage. “My, look at your legs!
Do all Britishers wear jazz suits in bed? I’ll say
old Cliff got a good laugh over that suit. My, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
quarter of seven ... I must hustle. By-bye, Ed,
gimme a hug. Call in at the office any time.”</p>

<p>When Edward said good-bye to his host and
hostess, Mr. Weber spat in a pointed and rude way
on to a spot near Edward’s left foot. It hurt
Edward’s feelings rather.</p>

<p>“Somehow I don’t get on with coarse people,
especially in America. Few people appreciated a
man of our Hero’s exquisite fibre,” he thought, without
much conviction.</p>

<p>Edward had two dollars and fifty cents. He was
not a very good manager but he lived on that money
for three days. He did not sell a single book.</p>

<p>“If I were the hero of a book,” he thought once,
“nobody would ever believe that I had made so
complete a failure of such a simple job. Never one
sale. Other people in books have ups and downs
in their businesses, but I have only downs—and
such deep downs. I can’t think what is the matter
with me. It is really that Emily is a part of me
that hasn’t fitted on yet—the successful and splendid
part. Emily and I could be a man and a woman.
Without her I am not even a man.”</p>

<p>“Never mind. I have only to wait. People
never go on in such an agony of wanting without at
last getting what they want.”</p>

<p>The further away Emily went the more did Edward
forget the hopelessness of his suit. He only
remembered the softer aspects of Emily’s face.</p>

<p>The roads he chose during those three days lay<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
often through forests. He avoided the open, wide,
concrete roads. “If I can get in with the little
ranches, that’ll be a cleaner field. Ranch people
have boys, I suppose.”</p>

<p>The boys did not seem to want culture in the
little ranches. Some of the women could hardly
speak English. Their replies were given in an
accent so exotic that the sense did not penetrate to
Edward’s faulty hearing. When he looked at their
faces, however, he was generally glad he could
not understand. He was not wise in his choice of
“clean fields.”</p>

<p>Bungalows infest the slopes of the Russian River,
yet almost every bungalow at which Edward knocked
was apparently uninhabited, except at week-ends.
There was no business there—still, there was the
Russian River. A rigorous red road sawed up the
dark high mountains on the south bank of the river.
There were trees everywhere. Young redwoods
against the sky were strangely bare and lancelike.
The sun made nothing of the inconsiderable branches
of the trees—it made clear only their proud back-bones.
There were madrones. One would expect
to bend a madrone like rubber; its stem has the
apparent texture of red rubber. And bent it is,
but only by great winds. Its stem and branches are
red and rose-red or gold and green-gold; it glows
like a pillar of jewels and precious metals. Once a
year madrone opens hundreds of little windows in
its scarlet and crimson tower, little green square<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
windows are cut in the bark, through which joy in
the heart of the madrone looks out at spring. At
those times it is as if there was, pouring from the
innumerable windows, a most gay green and gold
light into the forest—light where sunlight cannot
enter—a low, gay light in the forest shadows. But
now madrone’s windows were closed, madrone was
sealed up in its smooth shadeless red towers. The
glazed grape-colored stems of manzanita haunted
the shadows below the madrones. There were
columbines with their flowers strangely balanced in
the air like stage fairies. And most of the world
in sight was pricked by pines and firs in all shades
of green, ranging from a hot, live green to a green
that had almost the sheen of a Blue Persian cat.</p>

<p>The Russian River, far down, ran among mauvish
tapering islands of sand. It crouched low down
beneath the feet of the hills and the trees. The
sun-dazzle upon the river dodged behind the shoulders
of the hills.</p>

<p>Edward tried to “work” the self-conscious summer
villages and the concealed and suspicious mountain
hamlets. <cite>Milton for Our Boys</cite> seemed to be a
drug in the forest market. Talk of uplift withered
in the smell of the sea that came up the Russian
River.</p>

<p>Edward slept one night simply and uncomfortably
beside the prostrate bicycle under a twisted madrone
tree, on soil thick with intimate small weeds—soil
that for the first two hours was soft and seemed a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
vantage point from which to sing to the stars, but
for the rest of the night was hard and infested with
ants. Stars are stark comfort at three in the
morning.</p>

<p>All next day he was in sunlight on the naked low
hills that follow the line of the sea. The hills were
burnt; it seemed that they had even caught something
of the colour of flame. They were burnt
tawny gold and crimson. These were the naked
hills; they were done with the draperies of
spring.</p>

<p>Edward bicycled briskly. He felt rather ashamed
of having to move his feet in such a brisk prancing
way; he thought that he shewed the ridiculous jauntiness
of a toy dog.</p>

<p>He was approaching <i>The World’s Egg Center</i>.
The hills broke out into an eruption of white hens.
Edward thought that, just as every provincial
mother looks to London, so it must be every hen’s
ambition to have an egg making its début at the
<i>World’s Egg Center</i>. Twelve miles out of the egg
metropolis suburbs of hens were already thick on
the ground.</p>

<p>Apart from hens, the only flowers of that bare
country seemed to be boulders, great proud purple
boulders rooted in their own clear shadows. Sometimes
little wind-bent trees, like jockeys, rode the
boulders.</p>

<p>Edward called upon many chicken ranchers in the
hope of introducing Milton to their boys. He was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
becoming desperate. He had thirty-five cents left
in the world. Chickens must be an absorbing pursuit;
no rancher had any time or attention for
Milton.</p>

<p>Edward spent twenty-five cents on a very bad
meal.</p>

<p>After sunset he crouched under a leaning rock on
the slope of a hill. He slept well and in the morning
found his waking eyes on fire in the glare of a solitary
gold poppy, gloriously open within three inches
of his face. The poppy was thickly and incredibly
golden; its petals had a sheen like a little wind on
sunny water and, deep within its cup, dusted with
gold, was its treasure, a tiny unkempt chrysanthemum
of gold with a crisp core of black.</p>

<p>At the next ranch visited by Edward the disorder
of his clothes, after two nights under the dishevelling
stars, had its effect. A man in blue jeans, carrying
a bucket of grain, met Edward at the gate and
said, “We found and lifted the latch of the polar
star.”</p>

<p>Edward was no fool. After a second’s surprise
he realised that his ears were betraying him again.</p>

<p>“Sorry,” he said. “I didn’t quite catch what you
said.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t hear what you said.”</p>

<p>“You don’t need to hear anything except Keep
Out,” said the man waving at a terse sign rooted in
a whirlpool of chickens: KEEP OUT THIS<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
MEANS YOU. “We don’t want no hoboes
here.”</p>

<p>“My name is Edward Williams,” said Edward
urgently. “I want you to look at——”</p>

<p>“If you said you was William Randolph Hearst
I wouldn’t give a whoop. No, sir-ree, not in them
togs. ’S’plain enough, ain’t it?”</p>

<p>Edward bicycled briskly away. He looked himself
over when he was out of sight of the ranch.
His clothes were creased like the cheek of a nonagenarian.
<cite>Milton for Our Boys</cite> was an anomaly
as a bait at the end of that crumpled sleeve. He
would try no more. “Our Hero was never one to fly
in the face of fate.” He bicycled into the Chicken-City
and he was so much irritated by hunger that he
hoped he would run over someone and die in the
attempt. All the faces on the sidewalks made him
uncontrollably angry. He went into a saloon and
ordered a brandy. He was so angry that his voice
trembled. He would never see Emily again. He
would die in the suburbs of a chicken center. He
would find another gold poppy and it would pour
gold into his eyes until his eyes closed. Poppies are
better than pennies on dead eyes.</p>

<p>“Only a matter of a few days more,” said the
saloon keeper in a friendly voice.</p>

<p>“Being deaf is as bad as being haunted,” thought
Edward, wondering what the man had really said.
“A matter of one day more,” he grunted.</p>

<p>“No, <em>sir</em>. June thirtieth’s the last day and you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
don’t wanta forget it. I’ll say the boys’ll be around
that night. What gets me’s how the government
put it over, but—well, I should worry I guess.”</p>

<p>“He’s talking of Prohibition,” Edward realised.
“Well, by the end of this week I shall be prohibited
anyway.”</p>

<p>Just as the saloon keeper began another remark,
Edward turned his back irritably and sat down at a
table. The brandy combined rather badly with his
hunger.</p>

<p>There was a newspaper on the table. Rhoda
Romero’s name was on it in tall headlines.</p>

<p>Acquitted.</p>

<p>There was a snapshot of Rhoda, with a defensive
hand to her chin, walking with one foot up.
“.... Collapsed on hearing verdict.... Miss
Romero, who is in private life Mrs. Avery Bird
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">... yesterday, facing a possibility of a fourteen</span><br />
years’ sentence, not a muscle of her face (of a
Grecian type) twitches ... today, declared free
... attack of hysterics in court ... hides her face
among hubby’s vest buttons ... refuses to disclose
her plans ... will perhaps visit relatives in
the East ... complete nervous collapse....”</p>

<p>Edward felt absolutely no joy on Rhoda’s account.
“It’s no use pretending,” he thought.
“There’s no room in me now for anything but me
and Emily.”</p>

<p>He was very much excited. He read the account<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
three or four times. He recognised the dress that
Rhoda was wearing in the snapshot. He spoke to
the saloon keeper again.</p>

<p>“This is my greatest friend in California,” he
said in a trembling voice, hoping that the saloon
keeper would be very much interested.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you know about that?” said the
host, taking the paper patiently. “She’s a looker
too, I’ll say. Well, it’s good hearing for you that
she ain’t ona these Reds. We had a Red once
blaaing around in this city—wanted a hired man’s
strike....”</p>

<p>“Yes, isn’t it funny, I even know that dress. Those
little buttons are green.” Edward was quite unlike
himself. He was so hungry.</p>

<p>“Is that right? You bin going with her, I guess,”
said the saloon keeper, looking at him sharply.
“Well, who’s to blame you, she surely looks a classy
dame.”</p>

<p>“I want to go back to see her,” said Edward. “I
didn’t think I should ever see her again. Now she’s
free and anyone can see her.”</p>

<p>He was much pleased that his host thought he was
in love with Rhoda. He felt that the thing gave
him a halo of interest and pathos. He thought that
the saloon keeper would describe the incident to
other customers later in the day. “Had a guy in
here ... picks up the <cite>Examiner</cite> ... intellectual
looking guy too....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span></p>

<p>“I want to go back to her,” said Edward, “but I
haven’t a cent. That is to say, of course, I have
ten—enough, I hope, to pay for the brandy.”</p>

<p>“The brandy’s two bits,” amended his host doubtfully.
“That’s too bad. How come?”</p>

<p>“I bicycled here.”</p>

<p>There was a considerable pause.</p>

<p>“You don’t want to buy a book called <cite>Milton for
Boys</cite>? I’m a salesman. I’ve struck hard times.”</p>

<p>“Why, no,” said the saloon keeper, whose manner
was now rather colder. “We don’t have no use for
books, not in my lina business.”</p>

<p>Edward clung to the counter. He would never
leave it without money, he thought hysterically. The
saloon keeper went and served another customer,
whistling doubtfully as he did so. Then he produced
an account book and began writing down
figures. Edward held the counter tightly. He began
to feel faint with hunger and excitement. A noise
like mowing machines on summer lawns at home
was in his ears. The saloon keeper finally looked
at him.</p>

<p>“Want something to eat, brother?” he asked.
“I’d be willing.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Edward. He felt vaguely that to
accept food would lessen the force of his appeal.
There was a hopeless silence again. Edward’s head
drooped over the counter. He seemed to be looking
closely at the grain of the wood.</p>

<p>“The man must be touched by this,” he thought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
dimly. “I must look awfully white by now.” There
was a freezing feeling on the skin of his face.</p>

<p>“Now, see here, young feller,” said the saloon
keeper. “I hate to see you in bad. I’ve got a soft
heart, so the boys tell me. I’d kinda hate to have a
foreigner quit this city feeling mean like you feel
right now. I kin size up a man that’s on the level
as well as anyone. Now this is what I’ll do. You
let me see this wheel of yours and I don’t say but
what I kin loan you a few bucks on it.”</p>

<p>Edward leaned on the counter for a minute more.
“I might be able to redeem it,” he thought. “Anyway
Cliff said I’d probably skip with it, so he won’t
be surprised. It’s a little thing to do—for Emily.”</p>

<p>He wheeled the bicycle into the bar.</p>

<p>“Gee, she’s had some knocks,” said the saloon
keeper. He came round the counter and rang the
bell of the bicycle. “Next time you come around
this ways, mebbe ... well, brother, I’ll trust you.
You kin have a hot dog on me and a cup-a coffee.
I’ll loan you a coupla bucks on it. That’ll take you
as far as Frisco.”</p>

<p>“Obstacles are nothing to Our Hero,” thought
Edward and then, “Cliff won’t be surprised. Nor
will Pop. Pop will say that’s what comes of picking
up with a Britisher.’ He’ll spit and pretend he’s
spitting on England.”</p>

<p>San Francisco seemed to Edward to be set in
pearls. Pearl clouds bowled about the hills; the bay
and the Golden Gate had the opaque glow of pearls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span></p>

<p>The little tram lifted him up the steep streets
towards Rhoda—no, towards Emily. From the top
of the straight hill he saw the city lying in curious
leaning perspectives. Houses on other hills seemed
built upon each other like the stones of great pyramids.
The air was full of white sun and all the
shadows were trim.</p>

<p>Misgivings met him halfway up the wooden outside
stairway that led to Rhoda’s door.</p>

<p>No-one answered the bell. He could not believe
the silence. He rang again and again. No-one
answered.</p>

<p>He stood on the stairs with an empty mind. Then
he began to remember running down those stairs,
pursuing Emily after his first meeting with her. It
seemed to him now that he had not loved her at all
while she had been here, within reach. He could
not remember his past feelings. He could remember
nothing but looking at her. The Edward of
those days was a blank to him now. He had lived
then outside himself, living austerely on the intermittent
sight of her. Now he could not even remember
what it was that he had seen in her face, he
could not remember what it was that gave her eyes
that starred look. Was it because they were set so
deep under her strong black brows?</p>

<p>The janitress stood at the foot of the stairs.
“Mrs. Bird ain’t to home. Gawn south somewheres
in Louisiana. Didn’t you-all see it in the paper?
She done had a collapse.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span></p>

<p>Edward did not answer. He looked down at the
janitress. He could not see her feet; he was so
steeply above her. He could see, however, that
some of her hair was false and did not match the
rest. After a minute she was gone.</p>

<p>Avery Bird had come half-way up the wooden
stairs before Edward really believed that he was
there.</p>

<p>They looked at each other in unfriendly silence.</p>

<p>Avery looked frantic; his face was a yellowish
white; his thick lips were fixed in a straight line;
his cheeks were as hollow as though he were sucking
them in. Even his curly black hair looked
crushed.</p>

<p>After he had looked at Edward for a minute he
pushed by him and unlocked the door.</p>

<p>“Can’t you leave us alone?” he said.</p>

<p>Edward seemed to himself to dwindle. He could
hardly believe that anyone had spoken so. “Our
Hero—what? Are heroes so addressed? <em>Can’t
you leave us alone?</em> It is intolerable. I am an
absolute and appalling failure.”</p>

<p>With a limp hand he reached for the door as
Avery shut it against him. He touched the door in
a yielding way as a cat would touch it. The touch
was like magic. Avery opened the door again.
“Come in, come in. Oh, come in, come in,” he
said furiously. As he preceded Edward into the
studio he went on saying, “Come in, come in, oh
come in....” Poor Edward was coming in as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
quickly as he could. Dirty cups and plates were all
over the studio. The shades were down over all
the windows but one.</p>

<p>“I detest the sight of you,” said Avery. “You
are like a beastly disease in my house. You worried
Rhoda till she cried at night. Now she is gone, to
cry in another bed.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you mean.”</p>

<p>Avery did not know altogether what he meant.
There was to him something hideous and detestable
about Edward. Edward had been too much in
his sight. Avery was full of Jewish vigour himself;
the poorness and the pimples, the thinness and the
hesitancy of Edward were revolting to him.</p>

<p>“You don’t know what I mean? Didn’t you know
that Rhoda would have <em>paid</em> to get you out of this
country, out of her sight, out of the sight of all
decent people.”</p>

<p>Edward did not speak of the suggested commission
to take Rhoda’s pictures to China. He knew
very well that Avery was right. Rhoda would
have paid to get him out of her sight. That was
all she had meant. Her pictures, bad, mad, careful
pictures, were still on the wall.</p>

<p>“Now she has gone,” said Avery. “She has forgotten
me—she has worse than forgotten you.”</p>

<p>“Gone ... forgotten?” Edward thought. He
could not connect violent words with the serene and
reasonable Rhoda. He could not imagine her sturdy
neat face distorted by fury or hysteria.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span></p>

<p>Avery said, “What do you want? Are you begging
for her money again?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Edward. He sank down into a mire
of disgust. He was feeling sick.</p>

<p>Avery snatched at a wallet on the table. He
threw all the papers from it to the floor and there
was a roll of money clinging to the brim of the
wallet. “Take it, take it, take it, take it!” he
shouted, slamming down one fifty dollar bill after
another among the reeling cups on the table. “Oh,
take it, take it, take it!...”</p>

<p>Edward was taking it as quickly as he could.</p>

<p>“And for Christ’s sake get off this side of the
world,” added Avery. “You ... gopher.”</p>

<p>Edward backed a few paces towards the door.
Avery laughed. His face was twitching; his eyes
were burning red. He looked very ugly and almost
childish and Edward, as he realised this, felt braver.
He stood with his back to the door. He knew very
well that when he had disappeared, Avery would
put his head down among the unwashed cups. Why,
the man was already crying.</p>

<p>“You have been exceedingly rude to me,” said
Edward. He thought, “Our Hero threw one contemptuous
glance back into the room as he left.”</p>

<p>Edward went out. As he closed the door he
could hear the cups clash.</p>

<p>Edward could hardly believe in his own existence
when he found himself approaching China.</p>

<p>Japan had been nothing. A country packed with
color and little hills but empty of importance, being
empty of Emily. All in vain the veil of Fujiyama
floated over Yokohama; all in vain little pearl-like
clouds were strung round the shoulders of Fujiyama
in the indefinite sun. Edward only thought it
was very like its pictures.</p>

<p>When he rode in a little light ricksha through
the centreless streets of Yokohama, he thought,
“This is Edward Williams doing the things that
Sunday school children at home see on lantern slides.
But Our Hero remains detached, as in a dream.”
He was glad to feel detached, to feel that, unlike
the other passengers on the ship, he was not “doing
the Orient.” He was looking for Emily.</p>

<p>Afterwards he remembered more of Japan than
he had realised at the time. He had been inconsistent
enough to imitate the majority of the passengers
and go by train to Kobe. He had even
been chosen as escort by a stout, lonely lady passenger.
“Women were more and more interested in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
Our Hero as he grew older and sadder. Women
adore an atmosphere of tragedy.” It was true that
Edward had scarcely been able to hear anything that
the lonely lady said. It must therefore have been
his “mystic air of remoteness” that had interested
her. Or perhaps it was just that he was a man.
Together they had spoiled for themselves the
enchantment of the Kamikura Buddha by climbing
coarsely up the steps inside him. Together, in a hired
Ford car, they roared through the faery streets of
Kyoto in broad daylight without pausing to hear
the clicking pattens in the crowded quiet streets.
They did not wait to see the crouching lion outlines
of the temples against the multiplying stars of an
evening sky. All the flowers of Japan passed Edward
by. “I am no botanist,” he said proudly.</p>

<p>Japan haunted him afterwards like a ghost.
Afterwards he knew that he had shut his eyes.
Afterwards he knew that he had nothing to remember,
nothing but little sharp negligible details that
had pricked his idle mind—the white crests printed
on the backs of the blue-clad coolies—the paint on
the women’s faces—the way the women’s toes
turned in—the greasiness of the women’s hair—the
deformed look of the women’s backs in the
evening when they put on outer kimonos over their
broad thick obi sashes—the angry officious voices
of the policemen—the similarity of the Tokyo railway
to the London Underground....</p>

<p>After rejoining the ship at Kobe he had defiantly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
read cheap books all through the Inland Sea. At
Nagasaki he did not land. “I’m not a tourist—I’m
here on business,” he told a little fat bald American
business man, who had not asked him whether
he were a tourist or not.</p>

<p>Manila Edward ignored. He only saw one thing
belonging to Manila, a small Filipino woman with
gauze sleeves and ruffles starched as though she were
an Elizabethan, who came on board with her husband,
a little man, the upper part of whose body was
sensibly clothed in a garment of such transparency
that no single crease or roll of brown fat over his
ribs and stomach was hidden.</p>

<p>And here was Hongkong.</p>

<p>Edward woke up. He was alive to the bland blue
outlines of the Peak against the sky. Every scarlet
and gold flutter of the paper prayers on the importunate
sampans that raced for the liner was a message
from Emily to Edward.</p>

<p>People talked with English voices in Hongkong.
Edward could hardly hear what the women said.
England at last! He followed a couple of pink,
small-headed subalterns to the hotel. He heard one
say, “By Jove,” in a throaty English voice. Edward
felt no longer despised and exotic. He saw that
everyone in the hotel lobby looked cooler than himself.
But the faces were English and not complacent.
Or even if they were a little complacent—why
not?—they were English. He ordered a cocktail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span></p>

<p>“After that I will look in the register,” he thought.
“Perhaps Emily’s name will lie like a strip of light
on the first page I look at.”</p>

<p>He did not know Emily’s last name.</p>

<p>He could hardly believe for a moment that he did
not know her name. The cocktail was so good that
while he was drinking it he thought, “I shall think
of her name in a minute.” But nobody had ever
told him her name.</p>

<p>“I know Tam’s name at least.”</p>

<p>It was a pseudonym.</p>

<p>He deliberately interposed a blankness between
his brain and this disaster of a China rendered empty
of Emily. China to him meant Emily now. The
divorce of the two words—China—Emily—was inconceivable.</p>

<p>He studied the register. “If I see her writing I
shall recognise it—though I have never seen it.”</p>

<p>A long untidy addition sum of names lay before
him on the page. The result of the sum was—nothing.
He turned to another fruitless page.
Another. “Miss E. L. Spring, Walthamstow....
Mr. Irwin Scales, Binset, Somerset ... Mrs.
Irwin Scales....” The date of those was about
right. E. L. Spring? It was a blasphemy. Walthamstow?...</p>

<p>But the date was all right.</p>

<p>E. L. Spring was the only woman with the initial
E. There were dark horses all over the page, fiendishly
concealing the most important part of their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
names... Miss Framlingham, Delhi, India ...
Miss Wherry, London ... Miss Burnett, Canterbury
... Miss Something Illegible, San Francisco,
Calif.... They all sounded like thin women with
withered necks and little green veils hanging from
the backs of their hats, not like Emily.</p>

<p>He returned to the chair beside his empty cocktail
glass. His eyes had tears in them so he pretended
there was a fly in one of them. His throat
was compressed by distress. He could not have
spoken aloud. “I thought I left myself behind,” he
thought. “But I am still Edward Williams in
China. Myself has caught me up. Look at me,
crying now in a hot chair in Hongkong, I who used
to cry in the cold draught that ran through my
dreadful room in San Francisco.”</p>

<p>The heat was like stagnant steam. He felt sick
and very deaf. The only sounds he could hear
through the exasperating roaring of his ears were
the sharp cries of the chair-bearers outside the open
window, trying to attract patronage. The cool
vacant faces of English women moved up and down
in the shadow of the arcades outside. Edward could
not hear the clicking of their high heels, they seemed
to him to move subtly like ghosts.</p>

<p>It was terribly hot.</p>

<p>“I shall cry frankly unless I move about.” He
hung his self-conscious head as he left the hotel.
He tried to interest himself in the Chinese names
above the shops. No—not China now; China was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
a horrible half-name now. The Peak leaned like a
cloud over the houses. He could see a little train
sliding up the mountain, like a fish which some giant
fisherman was drawing up from the sea. He found
the station. The train was full, but, as Edward
approached it, an official, seeing him, turned out a
Chinese clerk in order that Edward might find a
place. Edward looked angrily at the patient alert
face of the ousted Chinese on the platform. “I don’t
care if his business is urgent,” thought Edward. “I
hope his wife is dying. It isn’t fair that only I
should be hurt.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear ...” screamed the hot English
girl in front of Edward to her hot friend. All the
women in the car were fanning themselves and talking
in a frenzy of foolish energy about men.</p>

<p>The car lifted them all up the hill. Dense dull
shrubs bordered the steep track. The houses seemed
to lean against the hill. The harbour was unrolled
at the foot of the mountain. A fringe of ships, like
tentacles round a jellyfish, radiated from the shore.
Kowloon, backed by crumpled hills, stretched out a
corresponding fringe towards Hongkong. Edward’s
ears cracked and clicked, affected by the change of
level.</p>

<p>He walked on the neat paths of the Peak. The
Peak seemed as hot as the seashore. “Must be
nearer the sun,” thought Edward confusedly. But
no, it seemed that he was above the sun; he had left
the sun behind floating on a thin delicate sea. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
was sinking in the sea. All the islands were blue
imitative suns, sinking in the sea. The whole sky
was the colour of fire. Edward could almost hear
the roaring of the fire in the sky. The sea was
suddenly sheathed in shadow; mists like snakes
writhed between the islands. The islands were no
longer sinking in the sea; they were buoyed up by
encircling mists. Why was it still so hot? The sea
closed and flowed over the sun. The fire in the sky
burned no more.</p>

<p>Edward thought, “She must have gone to Peking.”
At once it was cooler. “I will go to Peking tomorrow.”
At once he began to enjoy the thought of
China. A Chinese woman with a small gaunt face
in a bright blue tunic and trousers neatly pressed,
her sleek black hair in a spangled net, a neat white
flower in her hair, tottered by on small compressed
feet. He thought “Emily would have wanted to
kiss that darling woman. Perhaps she would have
kissed her. No, she would have stood and looked
back at her, she would have jumped a little and all
her body would have been electrified with pleasure.
‘Oh, look ... oh, look ... oh, look....’
The woman would have turned and laughed in
delight.”</p>

<p>He could not believe it when next day a schoolboy
English clerk behind a counter told him the price of
a journey to Peking.</p>

<p>“Say it again, please,” said Edward.</p>

<p>The boy said it again without referring to any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
book. He seemed to know the dreadful words by
heart, just as a torturer knows by heart the levers
that will hurt most.</p>

<p>“That’s seventy dollars more than I have,” said
Edward.</p>

<p>“Hard luck,” said the boy, looking at him curiously.
It seemed odd to him to admit such a thing.
“You can go by boat to Tientsin. That would save
you a few dollars.”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t save enough dollars for me,” said
Edward. He stood on the doorstep of the office.
“Well, I can’t stop here all day,” he thought. Several
times he told himself briskly, “Well, well, well,
I can’t stop here all day....”</p>

<p>He comforted himself presently by thinking, “I
must have tremendous courage to have got so far.
Many people wouldn’t have got out of that naked
little room in San Francisco.” He drew a little
courage from the illusion of his own courage. Presently
he realised that the world did not end on the
doorstep of a tourist agency. He found several
possible jobs in the newspaper. “English jobs sound
somehow less fierce than American jobs,” he thought
and, buoyed up by a desperate hope, he called on
the headmaster of an English school for Chinese.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you haven’t had much experience of
teaching,” said the headmaster, a gentle, uncertain
young man, looking at Edward unhappily.</p>

<p>“It is I who am afraid,” replied Edward courteously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span></p>

<p>The school was in great need of teachers. The
headmaster did not seem to mind whether the teachers
could teach—if only a specious appearance of
teaching was sustained in his dozen classrooms.
Edward was engaged at a small salary to live in the
school and teach a class of fifty boys in “all ordinary
English subjects.” There was one professional
teacher in the school—a woman. The other teachers’
desks were occupied by one or two unemployed
merchant seamen, some bright young women stenographers,
a stray woman journalist teaching “as a
stunt,” and two or three sullen Chinese whose classes
were always in an uproar.</p>

<p>Edward nearly fainted as the headmaster took
him into the classroom on the first day and introduced
him to the boys. “I am sure you will do your
best ... Mr. Williams who lives in England and
has spent much time in America ... giving his
time to help Class C in their study of English....
Now, boys, we must all do our best ... make Mr.
Williams welcome....”</p>

<p>While the headmaster’s shy voice wavered on,
Edward studied the faces in front of him. Half
the class was Eurasian; the other half Chinese.
There were one or two thin, glowing Indian faces
among the broad Chinese masks. Three Portuguese-Chinese
boys in staring striped suits with small
waists sat in the front row, trying successfully to
frighten Edward by means of an exaggerated look
of awe. With these exceptions the two front rows<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
were occupied by little boys who were physically too
weak to challenge the determination of the big boys
to sit behind unseen. Edward looked hopefully at
two little boys in the front row trying to look superlatively
good. Their lips were moving; they were
making a show of repeating the headmaster’s words
to themselves in order to make a good impression.
Over their heads Edward could see a dazzle of insolent
faces, laughing at him and at the futile gentle
enthusiasm of the headmaster. The big boys were
quite frankly talking. Sometimes even Edward
could hear their twanging voices. The headmaster
looked wistfully down the room at the disturbers
but made no comment. Edward felt his face fixed
in an expression that a martyr might wear. His face
was frozen. He could not change his expression.
He looked in sickly appeal at the headmaster, who
was now leaving the room. He looked in sickly
appeal at the boys.</p>

<p>There was a fearful silence, broken by one of the
big Eurasians at the back suddenly breaking into
song.</p>

<p>“Eh—tya—tya....”</p>

<p>“Now you must be quiet, please,” said Edward
huskily.</p>

<p>“Shall not I sing?” enquired the musician. “Am
not I having sing lesson every evening when school
finish?”</p>

<p>Edward ignored him. “I see by the timetable
that we should begin with a Scripture lesson——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, no sah—nevah Scriptchah. Monday mornings
we was having hygiene—no, we was having dictations—nevah
Scriptchah.”</p>

<p>The concerted noise of contradiction became
louder and louder. Edward felt as if he were caught
in a great roaring machine that he could not stop.
“Oh, silence ... oh, silence ...” he cried, tapping
the desk feebly with his pencil. He could not
stop the noise. He rose and flung his arms out.
“Oh, silence—I can’t stand this.”</p>

<p>The hysterical gesture produced a startling silence.
Then some of the big boys laughed.</p>

<p>“The timetable says Scripture and I say Scripture,”
said Edward furiously. “No-one else’s opinion
is needed. Now I want one of you big boys—I
don’t know your names yet—that one with a pale
blue coat on—to come and tell me how far you got
in the Bible ...”</p>

<p>“Please sah, you say no other man opinion was
needed.”</p>

<p>“Shut up, curse you.”</p>

<p>“Eh—tya—tya....”</p>

<p>“He sing a song for welcoming you, sah.”</p>

<p>The boy in a long pale blue coat stood in front of
Edward, unexpectedly abashed. His small eyes
seemed deliberately veiled with dulness.</p>

<p>“What is your name?” asked Edward.</p>

<p>“I new scholar.”</p>

<p>“You have a name, though,” insisted Edward.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, sah,” shouted another boy from the back<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
of the room. “He was having no name. He was
married man....”</p>

<p>“His name was Ng Sik Wong,” said one of the
laboriously good little boys.</p>

<p>“<em>What</em> is his first name?”</p>

<p>“Ng,” buzzed the whole class.</p>

<p>“I can’t believe it.” Feeling a little braver Edward
wrote down, “? Sick Wong—Scar on nose—pale
blue—halfwitted,” in his notebook. “Now,
... ahem, Sick Wong, you’re one of the biggest
boys in the class, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“I new scholar.”</p>

<p>“Almost big enough to be a master, eh?”</p>

<p>“Eh—tya—tya.... Hey, Ng Sik Wong—you
be master—number one class master—married
man....”</p>

<p>Edward pressed on. “So I’m sure I can depend
on you to try and help me.”</p>

<p>“I new scholar.”</p>

<p>“Go back to your seat.”</p>

<p>“Please, sah,” cooed a good little boy. “I shall
help you. I shall tell you where was we reading
holy book. Last Monday we have finish Matthew-holy-gospel-according-to
twenty four chapter. I tell
you my name, sah. I Rupert Frazer, sah.”</p>

<p>“Open your Bibles at the twenty fifth chapter of
Saint Matthew.”</p>

<p>Bibles flew about in the air. There was a riotous
noise of opening books and a few whines, “Please
sah, he steal my book ... please sah, Pong Poon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
Chong pinch me.... Sah, I have lose my Bible
since a long time....” The tallest of the smart
Portuguese boys in the front row rose.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, sah, what does it mean, Virgin?”</p>

<p>Edward’s skull was sweating. “A virgin—” he
began.</p>

<p>“Eh—tya—tya....”</p>

<p>“Surely the whole class has sense enough not to
ask silly questions.”</p>

<p>“Please, sah, you shall tell him ask Ng Sik Wong.
He married man.”</p>

<p>“Please, sah, tell him ask Ng Sik Wong wife—she
shall know what is virgin—I wonder....”</p>

<p>“A virgin is a young unmarried woman,” said
Edward, petulantly damning all virgins.</p>

<p>“But, sah——”</p>

<p>“In this case that definition is enough.”</p>

<p>“But, please, sah——”</p>

<p>“Begin to read, Rupert Frazer.”</p>

<p>In a high staccato voice which ignored punctuation
and sense, Rupert Frazer began to read.</p>

<p>“Please, sah,” said the tallest of the three Portuguese.
“Please excuse us leave the room, sah.” All
three rose as if worked by one lever.</p>

<p>“What for?” asked Edward.</p>

<p>“Eh—tya—tya....”</p>

<p>The three Portuguese stared at Edward in exaggerated
reproach and bashfulness.</p>

<p>(“And att midnight there wass a cry made be-hold
de brid-a-groom cometh go yee—”)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span></p>

<p>“Very well. Come straight back,” said Edward.</p>

<p>(“Less thah bee no eno for uss and—”)</p>

<p>“Oh, stop, Frazer,” implored Edward. “Next
boy, read.”</p>

<p>The boys on Frazer’s right and left began reading
in concert with furious glances at each other.</p>

<p>“Not both; the Indian boy.”</p>

<p>“I am Parsee,” said the boy, a small nervous looking
child. “My name iss Bannerjee.”</p>

<p>“Please excuse us leave the room, sah,” said the
first of a line of big boys filing past Edward’s desk
towards the door.</p>

<p>“Stop,” shouted Edward unsteadily. His head
was rocking with the heat and consciousness of
failure. “Go back to your seats.”</p>

<p>“Oh, sah, other teachah Mistah Ramsee he nevah
stop us.”</p>

<p>“Go on reading, Bannerjee,” said Edward. He
pretended not to see the last of the line disappearing
through the door. The departure of the disturbing
element gave rise to peace in the class.</p>

<p>“Watch therefore,” read a boy with a Chinese
face and a German accent. “For ye know neither
the day nor the hour wherein the Son of Man cometh.
Please, sah, is not it true dat nuns haf Our
Lord als Bridegroom?”</p>

<p>“Nuns iss virgins,” said one of the Parsees in a
shocked voice.</p>

<p>“Please, sah,” continued the German. “Iss it not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
Mystic Union between Our Lord and nuns? If we
not believing in Mystic Union between Holy Lord
and mankind iss it not true we shall be perishing in
outer darkness and there shall be whipping and
gnashing off teeth?”</p>

<p>“Everyone is free to have his own opinion about
these things,” said Edward, doubtfully. “Outer
darkness is only a parable in itself——”</p>

<p>“But the Bible say——”</p>

<p>“There are a great many interpretations of the
Bible’s words,” snapped Edward, feeling unhappy
and strangely alone among the quiet familiar words
in front of him. “Perhaps we should all be more
likely to agree on the general sense of this parable.
What do you think Jesus meant us to understand by
this story——”</p>

<p>“Not story, sah, it was holy parable.”</p>

<p>“Well, what can we learn from this parable?”</p>

<p>“We shall not know, sah. You telling us, after—we
shall be knowing.”</p>

<p>“Use your minds. What lesson do you find in the
parable?”</p>

<p>“We not virgins, sah.”</p>

<p>“Mistah Ramsee he nevah ask the thing he have
not teach.”</p>

<p>“This is Mr. Williams, not Mr. Ramsay,” said
Edward, whose confidence was increasing with the
increasing tranquillity of the class. “I will give you
three minutes in which to glance over the parable
again before answering——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span></p>

<p>“It mean—the wicked people shall perishing in
efferlasting fires,” declaimed the German.</p>

<p>“Silence for three minutes.”</p>

<p>There was an uneasy silence broken suddenly by
the opening of a side door. The woman teacher in
the next classroom stood in the doorway and spoke
in a contemptuous voice to Edward. “Will you
please restrain your boys from shooting their pea-shooters
at this door? The noise in the next room
is most disturbing.”</p>

<p>“Sorry,” said Edward, feeling lost again. “I’m
rather deaf. I didn’t know....”</p>

<p>“And you might like to know,” continued the
visitor, “that eleven boys from this class are playing
ball in the playground. I don’t know, of course, if
they have your permission....”</p>

<p>“Oh, well ...” said Edward. “My God, it’s terribly
hot, isn’t it?...”</p>

<p>The woman-teacher shut the door sharply.</p>

<p>Edward felt as if he were outside himself, as if
he could see himself leaning limply over his desk,
his damp mud-colored hair drooping forward—its
parting lost—his thin face shining with sweat and
almost certainly rather dirty, the red spots growing
redder upon his chin and forehead, his lower jaw
trembling although he was trying, by hard biting, to
hold it steady. “Even if I found Emily,” he
thought, “she would hate me now.” He could never
be cool or lovable in these thick weary English
clothes. Then he thought with sudden pleasure that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
he would buy a new suit, a cool pale suit in which to
meet Emily. He imagined himself, looking delicate
and tired and cool in a delicately pale suit, walking
triumphantly towards Emily along a Chinese street
between booths full of lilies. “Oh, look ... oh,
look ...” Emily would cry, throwing her arms up
in her exquisitely exaggerated way. “Oh, look ...
here’s that darling Edward ... looking like a
damned old primrose ...”</p>

<p>“Shall I went to tell Ma Lo Yung and other boys
come in to lesson?” suggested the saintly Rupert
Frazer.</p>

<p>“Yes, run along for Heaven’s sake,” said Edward,
trembling with various emotions.</p>

<p>The day was at last over. It seemed like two
days to Edward because it was cut in half by an
hour for luncheon. During this hour he could be
sullen and quiet; the half dozen other men teachers
took little notice of him. The women teachers could
be heard screaming in secluded mirth in another
room.</p>

<p>The week was at last over. Edward had half
Saturday and all Sunday to himself. Not quite to
himself, for on Sunday he had to be “on duty” for
half the day. He sat in the window of his room in
the shade of the big palm-tree outside. Heat
hummed through the garden, through the open
doors and along the dingy passages of the school.
Edward did not mind what the boys were doing—whatever
it was, they were doing it fairly quietly.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
Occasionally a tearing yell of laughter or a whine or
a shrill protest in Chinese was mixed with the hum
of heat and insects.</p>

<p>Edward was comforted by comforting spirits,
the contents of two bottles which were his only contribution
to the furniture of his room. These represented
the only money he had spent that week. The
new suit was still a dream. He taught in his shirt-sleeves.</p>

<p>He had nothing to do on Sundays. Yet he tried
to regulate his drinking. He made appointments
with himself. “At half past three I will have another....”
But sometimes he forgot and had another
too early. “It keeps off the mosquitoes,” he
thought.</p>

<p>One of the big Portuguese boys from his class
was standing in the doorway. “Please, Mistah
Weelims....”</p>

<p>“Have a drink,” said Edward. He thought the
boy looked rather beautiful; his black hair was so
thick and shining; it was brushed like a smooth
breaking wave.</p>

<p>Before suppertime there were six boys in Edward’s
room. “If you fellers would only behave
decently in class,” said Edward, feeling like a man
of the world surrounded by his friends, “we’d have
s’more parties like this....”</p>

<p>Edward stayed at the school for a month. The
boys were almost fatherly to him. Edward ceased
to assert authority. His system was based entirely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
on bribes. The system seemed to answer. Only
once during the month the headmaster sent a note
to ask that less noise be made in Class C. That
was when a boy hid behind the blackboard and over-turned
it upon Edward. This amused even the good
boys.</p>

<p>“A joke’s a joke,” said Edward with tears in his
eyes. The blackboard had shaken tears into his
eyes. Two of the big boys had their arms around
his neck, were roaring yells of laughter into his ear.
“This joke’s certainly on me. Oh, come now, go
easy.” He was straining after laughter. He
thought, “That’s the way to take boys, no frills, no
airs....” He thought he was fond of the boys.
He knew they were not fond of him. He was terribly
afraid of them. The note from the headmaster
was handed to him.</p>

<p>“A letter from Daisy ... he says we’re making
too much noise, fellers.”</p>

<p>He did not drink much in the day-time. Whisky
in such hot weather made him tremble, made him
unable to bear the noise and difficulty of the class
room. But after dinner, when at least it was dark
and one could pretend that the heat was lifted, he
drank a good deal and was comforted. But he
saved a great deal of his salary. He thought he
would look for an opportunity to leave. He would
be ill; it was quite easy for him to seem ill. He
would be obliged to go and see a great American
doctor in Peking about his hearing. He had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
engaged for three months, in the absence on sick
leave of one of the regular teachers, but he had no
sense of responsibility to the school. His brain was
full of prospective interviews with the headmaster.
“I suffer terribly with my ears and my sinuses. I
have just had a most dangerous operation. I need
hardly say it will be a matter of real regret to me
to leave the dear boys....” The headmaster
would say, “Of course, of course, I quite understand.”
Edward had not only no objection to telling
lies, he even failed as a rule to notice how
broadly he lied.</p>

<p>He did not have a chance to excite the sympathy
of the headmaster. He was turned out of the school
one Sunday.</p>

<p>Sunday was his day without fear, and when he
was on duty on Sunday afternoons, he drank a great
deal. His last Sunday passed like a dream; he had
no fear except the fear of the week to come. He
was aware that he was to preside at the supper of
the boarders. The half-dozen big boys who had
been “sharing the party” thought he had forgotten.
Edward laughed at this idea. The big boys shepherded
him downstairs to the dining room; they
linked their arms with his in facetious tenderness.
It was absurd, Edward thought. His mind was
quite clear and serene. He knew that he would have
to say grace. The boys’ food was very bad—the
boys told him so. How absurd to say grace over a
bad meal. Indeed it was blasphemy. He would be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
honest. He would be witty. What a curious perspective
of white faces along the tables. The boys
spoiled the austerity of the perspective by wearing
different-colored clothes.</p>

<p>“Let us pray that dinner today will be better than
it was yesterday.” (God does not mind a man being
witty at His expense.) “O God, who daily turnest
our bread into a stone——”</p>

<p>Well, even if the Matron was looking at him, she
could appreciate wit, couldn’t she? He laughed a
little to give her a lead. Her hard white collar and
cap seemed to heave like the ruff and crest of an
affronted bird. Women had no sense of humor.
And anyway it was <em>he</em>, not <em>she</em>, who was on duty.
He could say what grace he liked. The matron was
gone now. She had realised that she had no business
there. The boys were all laughing. They were
a broad-minded crew, these boys.</p>

<p>Someone took him quite rudely by the arm. It
was the headmaster. He looked drunk, Edward
thought. So that was how the headmaster spent
Sunday afternoons—and he a parson. He pulled
Edward out of the room. It was outrageous that
the headmaster should so interrupt Edward’s
duties.</p>

<p>After a short talk, during which the headmaster
gave voice to some most insolent personalities, Edward
realised quite suddenly that he himself was
drunk. He wanted immediately to go away from
the people who had noticed this humiliating fact.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
He wanted new faces around him, unreproachful
faces.</p>

<p>“I’m going,” said Edward; the chair span away
from him unkindly as he rose. “After the way I’ve
been treated——”</p>

<p>“Please go tonight,” said the headmaster.</p>

<p>Everything was going well. Soon he would be
away from these people who only witnessed his
moments of indignity. The boys would never triumph
over him again now. He would be alone,
travelling in search of Emily. People who did not
know him would think, “Who is that thin eager
young man with the far-off look in his eyes?”</p>

<p>The Matron packed his clothes for him. She did
not speak. She touched his possessions as though
they were dirty. The headmaster called a ricksha
for him and, without speaking, put Edward’s suitcase
into it. Nobody said good-bye. The stars
were like dew on Edward’s eyes. Inside his head
pulsed the impact of the ricksha coolie’s feet on the
ground. The street was narrow and crowded and
quiet, at least there were only voices in it. Across
the lighted booths and under the hanging bannered
shop signs hurried the coolies at a half trot on their
bare feet. Their burdens swung at either end of
long poles; they had slung the great absurd shields
which were their hats on their backs, the heat of the
day being over. “Hai-ya ho, hoi-ya hai-ya, hai-ya
ho, hoi-ya hai-ya....” Two withered women,
with thin bare legs under their turned-up trousers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
were beating a child’s garment with poles. Fierce
treatment for so small a thing. But the devil of
sickness was in the garment; it required fierce treatment.
The lights glared on the scarlet and gold
banners and on the gilt filigree woodwork that
framed the doors of the shops. It seemed as if one
heard noise more with one’s eyes than with one’s
ears. The glare seemed to drown the voices and
the barefoot tread of the crowds. Wherever one
street crossed another, however, there was a great
clamoring of coolies forging their own right of way
through the tangle. Edward’s ricksha coolie said
“Hao hao” when anyone crossed his path; the “hao”
was always in time with the thumping of his running
feet, as if jerked from his throat. Tall Sikh policemen
pushed coolies roughly about. In the sight of
the policemen the little crowd of almost naked beggar
children running after Edward momentarily
evaporated.</p>

<p>Edward could now pay for his passage to Tientsin
by sea and for a ticket from Tientsin to Peking.
He could not pay for the new cool suit of clothes.
Emily must take him as he was—hot or cold.</p>

<p>He was the only passenger in the ship to Tientsin.
It was carrying simply a great deal of indigo—and
Edward. It was intent upon this duty and stopped
at only one port.</p>

<p>A gentle and pleasant measure of eternity passed
over Edward. He lay on a chair alone upon the
deck, flattened between the soft sea and sky. Flying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
fish rained upwards out of the sea. The flying
fish made little scratches on the smooth sea. One
evening the ship passed the mouth of the Yangtze
River at sunset. An enormous plume of crimson
cloud leaned away from the sea up the river. Thick
polished plates of gold and crimson seemed laid
upon the smooth waves of the sea to the west. The
low hills at the mouth of the river were luminously
purple....</p>

<p>For many days the ship followed the coast, followed
it far off, like the timid disciple. There were
high unreasonable islands, suddenly before the unsuspecting
ship. The islands sustained an illusion
of life on their shores; they sent their hopes out
into the sea in little fishing boats. Once there was
a boat quite near. In it one man smoothed his long
unbound hair into a queue; another played on a
stringed instrument and whined a song; another indolently
directed the boat towards the bristling
stockade of floating poles that marked their net.
But it must all have been faery. No community
could really live such a secret life, a life so full of
things that would never be known.</p>

<p>One day passengers came on board in mid-sea, a
great crowd of birds, land-birds who knew nothing
of the dangerous skies over the sea. Hawks and
woodpeckers, sparrows and doves and little tits and
finches stood about the rigging pretending not to see
one another. The seagulls laughed at them. The
land-birds felt uneasy standing in these strange,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
black, even trees, they were too much puzzled to be
very much afraid of men. A red and green bird
walked about near Edward, hoping that it would
find a worm somewhere. Whenever Edward spoke
to it, it pulled itself self-consciously together but
did not fly away. A Chinese sailor caught a sparrowhawk
and tied it to the capstan by the leg. Wei-hai-wei
seemed to be the arranged destination of
these passengers. Like a Cook’s Conducted Tour
they all disembarked together in the most businesslike
way. Only the hawk, tied by the leg to the capstan,
was left behind looking sullenly across at the
sullen dark battleships that peered out of the harbour.</p>

<p>The three officers of the ship left Edward a great
deal alone. The captain was an Irishman, a fat,
fair man with great, serene, grey eyes. He had once
been, he told Edward pointedly, a slave to drink;
he had an idea that Edward was similarly bound.
He thought he could haul Edward’s soul to safety
on a thin string of sentimental reminders ...
“mother, waiting at home ... grey hairs in sorrow
to the grave ... England needs strong sane
men now ... devil’s brew ... I know, me lad,
I’ve been through hell on account of it....”</p>

<p>“Hell’s the word,” said Edward placidly, basking
in the light of the captain’s earnest missionary interest.</p>

<p>The captain would not allow Edward to drink,
either in the ship or at Chefoo—their only port of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
call. “You don’t know China,” said the captain.
“You youngsters simply don’t know how to behave
in China. In London now, two or three whiskies
and sodas ... no harm at all. But in China—I
tell you I’ve seen men arrive in Shanghai with babies’
complexions ... and five years after ... yellow
as a daffodil, bent, malarial, only fit for nursing
homes.”</p>

<p>Edward hoped that he would look only fit for a
nursing home when he met Emily. Then she would
think, “How he has suffered. How I have made
him suffer.”</p>

<p>Much of the indigo disembarked at Chefoo. The
ship seemed to have run aground on a brown island
of barges. This island was peopled by brown coolies
with vacant faces; their heads were half shaven
and half covered with hair like cotton waste; sometimes
they had bound their hair into chignons.
Under their unresting but unhurrying hands, their
island of barges became mountainous with sacks of
indigo. Many of the sacks burst; indigo oozed
down the slopes of the mountains; the coolies became
bluer and bluer; there was indigo in their hair
and indigo round their shoulders like shawls.</p>

<p>Edward and the captain walked austerely and
thirstily about Chefoo. The Chinese of Chefoo
seemed to be of a rougher race than those of Hongkong.
They even grated on the eye, Edward
thought. They were taller and hairier; their
clothes were neither neat nor complete. Their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
houses were ragged and indecent. The houses of
the missionaries looked to Edward even more impossible
than those of the Chinese. Outside one of
the mission gates a thin boy, quite naked, tortured
a yellow lizard. There were yellow, scarred hills
round the harbour. They trailed a silken hem of
white sand into the sea and, behind the town, a green
scarf of orchard land was thrown upon the shoulder
of a low hill.</p>

<p>Between golden castled hills the ship left the harbour
in the evening.</p>

<p>The Yellow Sea was really yellow. It was thickly
yellow and reflected no light. It was more like a
desert than a sea. The eye would have found a
string of camels crossing the sea no anomaly.</p>

<p>The Pei-ho River was yellow too. The ship entered
the river between low mud forts. Salt was
stacked on a broad streaky plain to the north. Primitive
windmills, like merry-go-rounds at English
fairs, whirled among the stacks of salt. The earth
was yellow, the water was yellow, the long slanted
wave that ran after the ship was yellow and, breaking
over the squeaking yellow babies on the shore,
left them a little yellower. The villages were of
yellow mud; the blind mud houses had no angles;
they were like beehives. There was a ragged yellow
camel kneeling self-consciously in a street; he
kneeled as though his hind legs were broken. A
little girl in dark strawberry red—an exquisite color
for a dweller in golden mud—watched the camel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
from a dark doorway. The boats in the river had
nets stretched between bending slim poles hinged to
their masts. When, worked by primitive levers,
these nets were bowed to the water and rose
spangled and silvered, the boats were like dragonflies
resting delicately on the water.</p>

<p>Tientsin ... a few dusty hours in a train ...
Peking. The train seemed to collide with Peking.
The high city wall approached the railroad at a
steep angle. The train seemed to glance from
the wall without impact. Edward found himself
outside the Water Gate, at the inner wall of
Peking.</p>

<p>He became a ghost in a soundless ricksha. Lights
pricked his eyes. There was nothing in this Peking
but houses transplanted from European suburbs.
There was an English bank, there were English business
men, English soldiers, French soldiers, small
serene policemen in commonplace khaki uniform,
several Chevrolet cars ... finally an immense
hotel, the road to which was lined by rickshas at rest
with sweating coolies sitting on their shafts.</p>

<p>“Emily can’t be here. This is not Peking. Peking
has been stolen away. Emily has been stolen
away.”</p>

<p>Edward took a room in the hotel. He did not
know how he would pay for it. He thought he
would be here forever; he hoped that he would
soon die; perhaps, through dimming eyes, he would
see at last the real Peking and Emily running<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
urgently towards him. “Too late, Emily ... too
late....”</p>

<p>The great lobby of the hotel was like purgatory.
Surely it would have held all the saints and sinners
of the world. The saints and sinners sat in large
absorbing chairs and at little tables, waiting till the
time came when they might do something else.
There was dance music in the distance, a beat like
a hammer behind one’s head. The beat fought with
the beat of Edward’s heart; it was intolerable. He
could hear and feel the beat of his heart louder and
louder as he drank cocktail after cocktail. Cocktails
here at any rate were better than they would
have been had he found the real Peking. A broad
serene face crowning a high-necked robe of green
gold filled Edward’s imagination when he thought
of Peking. Over that face a banner waved, and as
it waved the wild gold dragon on the banner whipped
his length about but could not escape. Even the
man who brought another cocktail had something
to say about this dragon, Edward thought. “The
moon is his saddle ...” the cocktail man seemed
to say. It was true; the dragon was saddled by the
curve of the satiny moon. Edward had seen the
moon from the other side of the Water Gate, when
the real Peking had still seemed to be in front of
him. Perhaps he could find Peking after all, in the
light of the young moon. It was very late. There
was hardly time to go to bed, not time, in his present
mood, to take off one damp, snarling garment after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
another, to wash his hot and tired body, to find his
way uncertainly into an unknown bed. It would be
morning in a breath.</p>

<p>He went out. He walked east. The air was
cool and the sharp brittle rays of the stars made
him feel as though he were on the verge of being
more widely awake than ever man was before.
Here were trees and a very broad moonlit street.
Here, suddenly, was Peking. A great gate cast its
mountainous tented shadow to his feet. The curves
of the roofs above the gate were high and ample
and optimistic. The moon shone through the deserted
windows of the high guard-house. There
were soldiers at the gate so Edward went no nearer
to its arch. But he waded in its clean shadow upon
the uneven dust of the street. He walked still east,
along very narrow streets. There were no straight
roofs at all; all the eaves turned up as if the roofs
were of drooping dark silk with their hems slung to
the stars, or as if the houses were dancing and
swinging gay skirts.</p>

<p>There was an open space; low trees splashed
shadows on white dust and wet grass. Peking was
not so tightly packed within its walls but that a wide
space might be left in the angle of one corner of the
walls, a space where goats and donkeys had their
lodging. Beggars slept here too, but Edward’s tread
on the dust did not wake them.</p>

<p>The walls barred his way. They were new-looking
walls, he thought, almost silver in the moonlight,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
the design of castellation fencing the outer rim
was unbroken. But the guard-house on the corner
of the wall looked forgotten and old. There was
a brick slope which climbed to the top of the wall.
Iron gates barred both the foot and the head of the
slope, but the gates were easily climbed.</p>

<p>Edward was on the broad weedy path that ran on
the top of the wall. The seeds of flowers and tall
grasses had accepted the wall as part of the soil of
China. Edward went into the high beamed hall of
the guard-house. The moonlight made strange and
glorious broad spaces of its dusty floor; its dazzled
windows looked out on naked moonlight. It was
so full of silence that its old walls cracked.</p>

<p>That corner of Peking was a watching corner. A
little further on the dragons of the Observatory
watched the stars. Great wild bucking dragons
bore on their backs or between their claws huge
secret instruments which, in the belief of men and
dragons, prepare the way of the Lord and make his
paths straight. The bronze dragons of the Peking
Observatory are only a little junior to history, but
Edward did not know that. He tried feebly to open
the locked gate and then forgot and left the dragons,
the spying and puritan dragons, holding their
check on the wild and dancing stars.</p>

<p>To the west Peking was like an enchanted forest
in the milky half light. No house declared itself
among the trees except the great insolent hotel which
raised itself like a banner of unworthy victory over<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
the quiet city. Beyond Peking, far away, were the
Western Hills, their outline a wild tossing together
of angles, their chequered surface broken by strange
folds and scars.</p>

<p>There was a light other than the moon. It was
not a sudden light but Edward realised it suddenly.
The dawn was creeping up behind him to devour him
unawares. The centre of the universe had shifted.
The dawn was a subtler miracle than was the
moon; the dawn succeeded to the empire of the
moon.</p>

<p>Light ran like a snake along the tops of the
Western Hills. There was a spear of flame along
the eastern horizon. Little escaping clouds caught
fire; there was an ominous look of molten gold where
the east made ready the first step of the stair for
the sun’s ascent. The sun pointed its sword abruptly
at Peking. The golden roofs of the Imperial City
most gloriously received the challenge. The city
threw away its cloak of mystery and the birds sang.
A blue cart, its long peak stretching forward as far
as the ears of the mule that drew it, its little fretted
windows set into the blue tunnel that covered it,
heaved slowly along a red track from the east into
the sunstricken city.</p>

<p>The dam of day had burst.</p>

<p>Edward thought, “Emily is somewhere, drowning,
asleep in that lake of sunlight. I can find her now.
I have begun finding instead of losing now....”</p>

<p>Where does hope set its roots? Out of what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
blessed and silly seed does hope rise like a flower,
fed by nothing more reasonable than a piercing of
sunlight through air full of birds’ songs? It is
curious how joyfully we pluck and wear at our hearts
that fatal hope that has sprung from the seed of a
dream or of the little wind that passes across the
morning.</p>

<p>“Hope is a true thing,” thought Edward when he
looked, later in the morning, at the hotel register.
There were the names.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“Mr. and Mrs. Tam McTab—not so well but
unfortunately more correctly known as</p>

<p class="noindent">Mr. and Mrs. Leslie Watson—” (Tam had
written facetiously).</p>

<p class="noindent">“Miss Emily Frere”—(in a small impudent
writing).</p>

<p class="noindent">“Master Stone W. Ponting.”</p>

</div>

<p>The clerk said that they had left some weeks
ago—here was the date—all except the young gentleman,
Master Ponting, he was over there—the one
drinking a lemon squash.</p>

<p>Stone W. Ponting was about thirteen years old;
his thick, upstanding hair seemed gray with dust;
dirt and freckles obscured his complexion; his hands
were dark with dirt.</p>

<p>“You’re Stone Ponting, aren’t you?” said Edward
nervously. “Mrs. Melsie Ponting’s boy?”</p>

<p>“Yump,” said Stone, speaking into a glass of
lemon squash.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span></p>

<p>Edward was afraid of him. He never really
believed that boys of thirteen had no longer the
power to twist his arms.</p>

<p>“Have you heard your mother speak of me—Edward
R. Williams?”</p>

<p>But Stone, who had an abnormally long tongue,
was using it to explore the outside of his lower
cheek, in the hope of prolonging by a second or two
the taste of lemon squash. Apparently failing in
this he peeled the paper from a strip of chewing gum
and inserted the contents. He did not answer
Edward but, on the other hand, did not destroy
hope of an answer by shutting his mouth. The
chewing gum, though active, remained in the public
gaze.</p>

<p>Edward felt helpless but, in such a cause, dared
not cease his efforts.</p>

<p>“What’s happened to Emily and her friends?” he
asked. “Didn’t you come here with them?”</p>

<p>“Yump,” said Stone. “Hey, boy, gimme my
check. I must hustle. Going out horseback riding
with the Doc.”</p>

<p>A shower of money fell from his pockets as he
rose and the re-assembling of this gave Edward an
opportunity to speak again.</p>

<p>“No, but truly, I want awfully to know about
Emily and the others. I say, if you’ll stay and give
the Doc a miss for today, we’ll go somewhere and
find a real American soda fountain.”</p>

<p>He thought Stone might strike him. Or perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
Stone would simply walk away, dwindle through the
door and be lost in the sunlight forever.</p>

<p>“Sure I’ll stop,” said Stone W. Ponting, putting
out his tongue meditatively and sitting down again.
“We kin get a dandy nut sundae right here. Nut
sundae’s mine.”</p>

<p>“Why Emerly’s went up the Yangtze Ki-yang,”
he told Edward in reply to three or four more
questions. “So’s Tam and Lucy. Peking fer mine,
I said, when they wanted to have me go withum.
My dad’s sent me plenty of dough, so I should
worry. My dad’ll be tickled to death to have me
withum. He and Mom bin fighting for the custody
of me. Dad won. But he had to go to <em>Japan</em> or
some place on business. He’s a finan<em>cier</em>.”</p>

<p>Edward was neither acute enough nor sufficiently
interested to notice the sad bleak defences the
child had put up for himself against a hard world.
Edward thought, “A detestable child. He has too
little imagination and too much horse-sense to help
me.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t Emily supposed to be looking after
you?”</p>

<p>Stone gave a sharp cracked laugh. “I guess Mom
thought so. Mom’s kinda soft. Emerly knows I’m
a feller kin look out for himself. Dad wouldn’t give
a whoop. He don’t know yet, but he should worry.
He’s a financier. He sent me a thousand bucks to
blow—till he could come back from Japan. I got
the letter, that is to say, it was addressed to Emerly.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
There was a thousand bucks for her to blow on me
insidum. Emerly’s a sport, I’ll say. She acted like
she was leaving me in charge of a dame here—so’s
Mom wouldn’t get mad at her for piking. But
there was nothing to that. The other dame don’t
worry me any.”</p>

<p>“She is shameless,” thought Edward. “Loving
Emily is like loving a tigress.” He felt a better
man because he loved the shameless Emily. It was
like a romance among supermen, he thought.</p>

<p>“Your mother asked <em>me</em> once to take care of you
and bring you to your father. I had business at
the time that prevented me. But she was very
anxious that I should. Perhaps she told you——”</p>

<p>“Mebbe,” said Stone indifferently. The nut sundae
nearly oozed out of his mouth, but was checked
by sleight of suction. “She’s kinda soft, is Mom.”</p>

<p>“You oughtn’t to be here by yourself.”</p>

<p>“I’m sicka being handed around,” said Stone.
“Hey, boy, another nut sundae. And then some.
I’m a shark for nut sundaes.”</p>

<p>“Well, we can be friends anyway,” said Edward
shyly. “A man can be friends with another man.”</p>

<p>Stone took no notice of this. He lifted up the
corner of his jacket and licked from it a lump of
nut sundae which had accidentally fallen there.
Then he walked away, whining a little song.</p>

<p>Edward had not slept at all. The hope he had
nursed a few hours earlier seemed divorced from
reality. He remembered suddenly something that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
his mental cowardice had swept from his mind.
“Emily loves Tam,” he thought, trying to hurt himself
as much as possible. “Emily has never thought
of me again. She loves Tam. She wants to steal
Tam from Lucy. She is shameless. She is full of
fury because she has not got Tam. I am to her the
least of the people she met over there somewhere
in America, while she was engaged in pursuing
Tam.” He was determined to throw himself into
an agony, he was revelling in fatigue and despair.
He imagined his next meeting with Emily. Her
fierce eyes would detach themselves reluctantly from
Tam’s face. They would turn cold as they rested
on Edward’s own face. Edward’s face would look
dull and pale; he felt very conscious of the lifelessness
of his face. He saw himself so grey as to be
almost invisible. Near him now there was an arrangement
of mirrors that showed him his own
rarely seen profile. It was detestable that life—
even the mean allowance of life that was his—should
be given to so poor a body. His upper lip was too
long, it sloped forward without the curve that enlivens
most human lips; his chin was thin and fleshless
as though made of paper. His face seemed to him
hardly a human face. His shoulders were very
round. Out of the corner of his eye he watched his
reflection in profile present a cocktail glass to that
slack sad mouth. Cocktails at least were left to him.
Everything that requires only weakness was left to
him. “If all this were not so, this is what I would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
do.” The intensity of his despair was, with the
help of the cocktail, defeating its own ends ...
“if love perhaps gave me life ... if I were as
shameless as she is ... and if shamelessness could
give me a little of the splendour that it has given
her, this is what I would do ... I would get control
of that thousand dollars ... I would travel
night and day, in fury and certainty ... I would
find her on the banks of the river, the high reeds
as high as her head ... I would walk to her
with a new tread, a heavy, sure, new tread, and
when she looked she might love me or hate me ...
but she would remember me then.” And
now, though he tried again superficially to revive
his luxury of despair, he could not really think
himself despicable. His coward mind leapt at the
accuser from behind, and in the dark and the dust
the accuser was strangled. Edward smiled at the
boy who brought him a fresh cocktail. When he
smiled he saw now that his upper lip curved after
all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span></p>

<p>In the evening Edward met Stone Ponting in the
corridor. The boy looked pale and hysterical.</p>

<p>“I bin out with Doc. He’s bin setting me up
cocktails. Some drink I’ll say. I’ve had cocktails
before, though—a boy and me knoo a man in Sacramento
... the other feller had a Buick.... I
ain’t no sneezing innocent, believe me....”</p>

<p>Edward followed him into his room.</p>

<p>“I’ll say I’d be kinda lonesome here, without Doc—him
and me’s buddies. Emerly was a sport, I’ll
tell the world. Her and me raised hell in this one-horse
city. My, we made ona these Chink traffic
cops mad one day, having ricksha races.... Doc’s
a piker. I didn’t feel but a little queer after that
cocktail and now he says he’ll never buy me another.
I tell you I ain’t no snivelling kid—he’s a piker—I
feel queer now and no mistake.”</p>

<p>He was very sick. Then he began to cry. Edward
sat on the edge of the bed and patted the prostrate
boy’s knee awkwardly. All the time Edward
was thinking, “This boy’s going to depend on me
absolutely within a few hours. A thousand dollars....
Besides, it’s my duty to look after him.
Melsie’s a friend of mine....”</p>

<p>“There must have been poison in that hooch,”
sobbed Stone. “Mebbe Doc’s a thug, after my thousand
bucks.... ’Sociating with foreigners has
ruined him. Emerly was a sport though she was a
foreigner.... My, I’m lonesome without Emerly,
I don’t mind telling you. Emerly and me was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
affinities, like Mom and Lon Merriman. But she
quit. Doc says women are all that way.” He cried
again hideously. “She useter kid me along. She
useter make up tales about the stunts Tam could put
over. She said he was a saint like in the Bible. Her
and me was sharks for the polo-game. We useter
went and look at the polo-game and she useter kid
me along about the things Tam done when he went
to the polo-game. It was like the tales in the kid’s
supplement of the Sunday papers. Once she said he
waved his stick and there was eight balls on the
field so’s all the guys went off quite happy with a
ball and they all shot a goal, and often, she said,
he’d stick the ball on to the ground by magic and the
fellers’d whack at it and whack at it and ride over it
and curse at each other for missing it ... just
kid’s tales, but the way she telledum just tickled me
to death someway. Gee, makes me laugh right now....
I don’t mind telling you, this is a bum city
without Emerly.”</p>

<p>He was still crying a little but the effect of the
cocktails was wearing off and soon he would hide
himself again behind his rude walls.</p>

<p>“Emerly and me was going to take a look-see at
the Big Wall. I dunno why she quit. I can go by
myself, I guess. I got a thousand bucks. Still,
Emerly’s a piker.”</p>

<p>“You and I’ll go and see the Big Wall,” said
Edward. “You and I’ll be buddies now. We’ll
go tomorrow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span></p>

<p>They went to see the Great Wall. Stone Ponting
found great pleasure in taking the tickets. Doc
came with them, a stout, red, young man with a fixed
smile, which only faded during his frequent and
earnest seizures of laughter.</p>

<p>They went up to the pass on a pig train from
Nankow; they sat on the running board of the train
and their sight was haunted by walls creeping furtively
round the mountains and by dead walled
towns.</p>

<p>The Great Wall, however, was not furtive. It
gloried in its fight with the mountains. It condescended
to conquer only the fiercest slopes. It pursued
splendidly terrible edges. Edward, looking
down from the broad road on the wall at the pale
bleak valleys towards Manchuria, was oppressed by
a sense of tottering and fearful height. But when
he leaned over the battlements and looked down
expecting to see straight into dark, dragon-haunted
abysses, there was the grass like an assurance of
safety a few feet below him, and there were the
little intimate blue and yellow flowers in the grass,
holding out hands to break the fall of courage. All
the way down the steep mountains there were flowers
among the rocks. The rocks might have been the
graves of enemies of China who had failed and
fallen on the green grass, failed and fallen and
never set foot on the land within the wall. The
wall itself was low; it lay flat like a snake in the
sun; it was more sinuous than anything built of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
brick had any right to be. When it linked crag
with crag it was so steep that, to follow it, travellers
must sometimes crawl on hands and knees up very
steep steps, clinging to the rank weeds and grasses
that grew between steep stones. Astride of the
wall, at regular intervals, were the watch-towers,
entered by arched doorways. The wall looped its
length sometimes; there were wanderings of walls
within the wall. Wherever one looked the mountains
were crowned and mocked by the wall.</p>

<p>Doc hardly had time to look at the wall, he was
so busy photographing it.</p>

<p>Stone was frankly bored.</p>

<p>“Can’t be but a dozen feet high,” he complained.
“They ought to see the Capitol at Sacramento or
some of the buildings on Montgomery Street in
Frisco.”</p>

<p>They walked down to the train along the paved
camel road that for two thousand years has carried
travellers from Manchuria to Peking. It is a dead
road now. Occasionally a string of camels or donkeys
threads its way through the crowds of travelling
ghosts, but a Ford car would disdain the road now,
so it is dead.</p>

<p>Doc’s Chinese boy, an efficient, cheerful old man
who never apparently opened his eyes, was waiting
for the three travellers at Nankow with a string of
donkeys. Stone proudly produced money whenever
it was needed, and Edward had nothing to do except
humour Doc’s passion for photography. Edward<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
was certain, even while posing with a self-conscious
smile between two donkeys, that, by the time the
films were developed, Doc would have forgotten
the very name of Edward R. Williams. The snapshot,
stuck in an album, would be introduced to
friends as “Yes, that’s a feller—I forgot his name—anyway
we were starting off on donkeys—I forget
where to....” The snapshottist is the most catholic
of all artists.</p>

<p>They rode first through Kao-liang and then
through orchards to the Ming tombs. Each rider
rode in a little dream of donkey bells and of affectionate
conversation between the donkeys and the
running drivers. The drivers said “Trrk trrk” and
“K’erh-to” and “Tsou-pa” and “Yueh,” and the
donkeys danced along, crossing their delicate little
hoofs as if on a tight rope, and signalling with their
soft dusty ears.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Very close to a road of rust,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Very close to the red ground,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till he dies he dwells</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the dust</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of his donkey’s feet, in the sound</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of his donkey’s bells....</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The travellers reached the Ming tombs at Sunset.
The precarious last light of the sun was spilled over
the shining golden roofs. There was a master tomb
crouching among its many courtyards, and the
disciple tombs on the wooded slopes imitated it respectfully.
The marble steps and the carved and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
knotted marble balustrades seemed to hold light. In
the main hall of the main tomb great plain trunks
of trees were the pillars bridging the dusky air between
the candle-lit pavement and the ceiling. A
little marble empty coffin in the innermost place was
the only reminder of the fact that the brittle and
ridiculous bones of a dead man were the treasure
in this sombre splendid casket. This was man’s defence
against his smallness. “Never dust to dust
now,” said the dust of the dead Emperor. But his
defence was crumbling. The marble and gold pavilion
and the years were playing him false.</p>

<p>Edward could not sleep on his camp bed between
the great pillars of the entrance. He leaned his
chin upon the marble balustrade and watched the
darkness. The writhing outlines of cedars and pavilions
in the starlight were gold no more. The
dragons and the branches of the cedars wrestled
together in the dark and were entangled.</p>

<p>Edward was desperately patient with Stone Ponting.
He was comforted in this period of doubt by
the constant mention of Emily, but he knew Stone
well enough now never to suggest that they should
go together in search of her. It was impossible for
Edward to be charming and Stone did not care for
him at all. But they both tried to disguise foolishly
delighted smiles when Emily’s name was mentioned,
and both were conscious of the impossibility of
boring each other on a topic which both took pains
to introduce.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span></p>

<p>They rode together in Peking. Edward was a
bad horseman but he always felt rather heroic on
a horse. They rode outside the walls of the Forbidden
City.</p>

<p>“I’d like to see a eunuch,” said Stone. “Doc’s
bin talking no end about eunuchs. Say, listen, did
you know they can whatch women in their tubs ’n’
everything and nobody give a whoop? When I was
a kid I useter think eunuchs was a Turkish tribe.
These Orientals is all queer. Say listen, Edward,
d’you reckon we could tell a eunuch if we seedum?”</p>

<p>“I guess so,” said Edward. “Let’s keep our eyes
open.”</p>

<p>The Imperial City has rose-red walls and the
guard-houses on the walls have golden roofs. The
guard-houses are like jewels having many facets.
The elaborate horizon of the roofs is like a thread
on which are strung fantastic jewels—red and gold
and green and turquoise blue. Dragons and strange
fishes and curling waves and plumes are strung upon
the fringe of the pale sky. The central gate is the
great pendant on the breast of the sky; the dark
door of the city is set in a square mass of red plastered
wall and over the archway the lines of the gold
tiles are dramatically sober. The moat at the feet
of the red wall holds a clear strange dream of all
these things, reflections caught in a mesh of floating
lotos leaves. Above the city fly the pigeons. The
owners of the pigeons apparently fit their birds with
little Æolian harps. A whispered wailing of flocks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
of pigeons falls constantly like an intangible tuneful
rain upon Peking.</p>

<p>“From Coal Hill you kin see right inside the city,”
said Stone. “Doc says the eunuchs live under the
blue roof and the big bugs under the yaller roofs....
Emerly and me and Doc had a picnic on Coal Hill.
Emerly fed Cigarettes to the Chink soldiers—they
was tickled to death—and she told us a crazy tale
about a toob of Colgate’s shaving soap that one of
these Chink empress dames figured was a love dope.
Say, listen, I guess Emerly ain’t more’n ten years
older’n me. Lots of men gets married to dames
ten years older’n them. A feller at school called
Jenkinson got married when he was eighteen. I
guess I gotta have a speel with Dad and, if he
raises hell about me being too young, I kin hand out
all kinds of dope like that.”</p>

<p>“You’d better make sure of Emily first,” said
Edward.</p>

<p>“Whaddyer mean—make sure of Emerly?” asked
Stone, who was in a brave rude mood. “Emerly’s
crazy about me, I tell yer. She certainly was peeved
when her boss moved her out of Peking.”</p>

<p>“Crazy about you!” said Edward, who felt glad
that nobody else could hear him thus debating grotesquely
with a shadow. “Might as well say she’s
crazy about me. Don’t you know who she’s crazy
about?”</p>

<p>“Aw, cut it out,” said Stone uneasily.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you see her look at Tam?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span></p>

<p>“Fergit it. Tam’s married. Emerly’s straight, I
tell yer. Emerly’s not like my Mom. Any guy that
says Emerly’s crooked’s going to hear from me....”</p>

<p>He spat angrily but neatly into the moat. Not
many boys so young as he acquire so much proficiency
in the characteristic arts of their native land.</p>

<p>Edward watched him and was afraid of him.
Edward himself as a child never spat and never
played roughly with the feelings of men and women.
He had never dared, yet his had been a safer world.</p>

<p>“Emily is shameless, I tell you, Stone....”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At Hankow Edward and Stone found that they
had almost too much money. In order to go to
Chungking—one of the few cities in the world without
a Thomas Cook—they had to change their eight
hundred American dollars into a much larger number
of Mexican silver dollars. Their suitcases were
rooted to the ground by the weight of their silver.</p>

<p>“Let me borrow some from you,” suggested
Edward, turning scarlet in a way that proved his
honesty to himself. “It’ll be a purely business transaction.
I’ll pay you two per cent per month. I want
a thin suit of clothes.”</p>

<p>“Sure, go ahead,” said Stone.</p>

<p>Edward bought a cream-colored ready-made suit
and saw in the mirror that he looked like an unsuccessful
dentist. He walked hurriedly out of the
store to escape this dreadful ghost.</p>

<p>“You look like thirty cents,” said Stone, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
seemed to have inherited his mother’s frank callousness.</p>

<p>They embarked on a wide sunny little steamer for
Ichang. Edward sat on the deck day after day and
saw failure gathering like a cloud about his hope of
Emily. He reminded himself industriously of his
hopelessness and of the fact that he looked like
thirty cents. Edward never, in the whole course of
his life, forgot any derogatory personal remark
made about himself in his hearing. He luxuriated
too much in the criticism of others to forget it.</p>

<p>Edward noticed the bald leathery water buffaloes
at work in the flat fields; he only noticed them because
he thought their faces were like his, like his
own face reduced—or magnified—to the absurd.
This idea made him watch for the closer buffaloes
with a morbid eagerness. On the tilted swaying
back of one near the tail sat a little boy in a broad
hat, playing the flute and drumming his heels. The
buffalo went dismally past its fellows who were lying
dismally in the mud; it had not enough strength of
mind to defy the little boy and give itself up to its
one dismal pleasure. Black trails worn by the tears
of years streaked the buffalo’s face; its horns
drooped awry.</p>

<p>The river ran so smoothly that it was like a broad
road of polished golden glass. It seemed that the
eyes were deceived—nothing so unruffled could pass
so swiftly. It seemed to Edward that he was flashing
above its still surface, the cords of the western<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
sun had snared him and were snatching him from
himself. Beneath him time and youth and the river—flowered
and golden—stood still and were left
behind.</p>

<p>A dull but hot sun laid shadeless light on the exact
pyramid hills that stand about Ichang and the mouth
of the Yangtze Gorges.</p>

<p>Edward and Stone carried their silver and Stone’s
ukelele and golf-clubs on to a new boat. The new
boat, battling against the terrible protest of the
river, thrust herself into the yellow shadows of the
mountains. One could feel the muscles of the strong
ship wrestling with the river. The ship swung; it
advanced, it bowed sideways, it reared, it faced the
fearful cliffs, it seemed to save itself narrowly from
disaster every minute. The river screamed about
the ship. The hot sunlight was wild with noise; the
shadow of the cliffs was impregnated with terrible
deep echoing. The river was a maniac prisoner
between the tense leaning golden cliffs.</p>

<p>Curious turbulent dreams haunted the water. The
surface was flowered and starred with strange boiling
shapes; ominous shadows—like hands and serpents
and gaping faces—were half seen beneath it;
scars of foam were scored across it. The water was
too wild to conform to natural laws or to find its
own level. There were fifty different levels between
cliff and cliff. There were table-lands and canyons
in the water, and glaciers of water tilted over hidden
rocks. The whirlpools were like sunken golden glass<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
bowls in the water. Or they were like great birds’
nests, great faery rocs’ nests with eggs of cream-gold
foam spinning deep down in the nests.</p>

<p>Close to the cliffs, the water, in a frenzy of contradiction,
flowed the wrong way. Junks could sometimes
move upstream without difficulty there. All
the upstream junks clung timorously to the red cliffs;
they were towed by scores of coolies. Strings of
coolies, like beads, tawny or blue, were looped along
the bright cliffs. The ropes were tied to the masts
of the junks. Women crouched under the hooped,
humped matting that covered the junks. A down-stream
junk span down the centre of the river. A
dozen oarsmen stood on the lower deck and on the
poop stood their leader beating time frantically like
the leader of an orchestra. The chantey of the oarsmen
was as thin as a hair of sound in the voluminous
voice of the river. The oarsmen swung and dipped
and bowed and fell back in time to the frenzied
baton of their leader. The junk looked dark and
nervous, dipping like a dark whale. Again it darted
heavily like a bee at the whirlpools in the water; it
made clumsy feints towards the shining sharp rocks
and the cliffs; it twisted, plunged, heeled half over,
shuddered, span round and round. Yellow waves
washed the knees of the oarsmen but still they sang.</p>

<p>Sometimes there were loopholes in the prison of
tumultuous noise and shadow. Sometimes the cliffs
were cloven and a tranquil and compressed perspective
of sun on apparently heathery moorland and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
serene red-flowering cotton trees, peered down the
cleft. Sometimes the mountains fell back as though
exhausted by their fighting and between broad open
shores the river ran more patiently. Then there
were towns and temples on the slopes. Shih-Pao-Chai,
a square tower of rock, challenged the ship at
a wide bend in the river. Like the shadow of the
rock, like its soul or its guardian angel, a tall pagoda
was built against it, with nine roofs one above the
other. The nine gracious roofs were like nine
branches springing from the living rock. Once there
was a town in a gorge built on two shelves of a sheer
ochre cliff; ladders led from one shelf to the other.
Sometimes there were greater towns, their lower
streets standing precariously on stilts in the river.
Sometimes there were temples with curled green or
yellow roofs and painted walls, looking down worn
steps at the river. Once the ship tied up at sunset
opposite the single line of a black slope against a
fading green sky. The line blossomed into the outlines
of temple roofs, bending, bristling roofs under
great tiers of trees and the silhouette of a defiant
griffin with plumed wings and tail.</p>

<p>One day the spell was broken. There were grey
soldiers on the bank. There were junks full of soldiers
moored to the bank. Three soldiers stood on
the lowest step of a temple with their rifles aimed at
Edward’s eye—as it seemed. The moment seemed
to call for an act of heroism. “Our hero’s first
thought was for the women and children,” thought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
Edward, calling Stone huskily as he ran behind a
door.</p>

<p>“Crack—crack ... crack.” One report was
long after the others. “A Chinese Edward R. Williams,”
thought Edward. When he came out of
cover the brigands had not moved from their stone
step. Their rifles still looked into Edward’s eye
across fifty yards of shimmering air. Something
ought to be done about it.</p>

<p>“Crack—crack ... crack.” It was like a
word in a nonsense language, a made-up word that
did not convey any meaning. A secret and negligible
sound.</p>

<p>“Crack—crack....” The Chinese Edward Williams
failed altogether this time. Probably he had
forgotten to load the thing. It would be just like
him. The whine of a bullet was heard so quickly
that nothing was realised except an after-taste of
sound. A fountain leaped in the water.</p>

<p>“Now watch,” said one of the ship’s officers. The
ship’s syren cut off the end of his utterance. The
syren’s sound was like a warlock springing up with
both bony hands straight over her head. Springing
and sinking ... springing and sinking ... to
frighten children.</p>

<p>Terror and astonishment wiped one of the brigands
from the temple step into the river. He
flashed into oblivion; his desperate hand made a
little passing splash in the river. All the men on
deck laughed. “That was the Edward who fell in,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
thought Edward, laughing a little too. “Just like
him.” The other two brigands ran away. The
syren was such an unexpected retort. There was no
declaration in the voice of the syren. Doubt made
them run away.</p>

<p>“Gee, look at the corpses....” said Stone. One
dead man pursued another furiously down the river.
They floated on their faces, legs and arms wide-thrown.
They looked like dead spiders.</p>

<p>“They’re always fighting about one thing or
another up in Szechuan,” said the ship’s officer in an
irritated voice.</p>

<p>Edward thought of Emily’s voice, “Oh, what a
party....”</p>

<p>“She will enjoy dead men,” he thought.</p>

<p>But there was, it seemed, peace in Chungking, at
least for a few hours after the ship arrived. The
junkmen were taking advantage of the peace; they
were leaning out of their junks armed with poles
and arresting the procession of the dead in order
to take the coats and sandals that were no longer
needed. The retreat of the dead was easy now and,
though they had a long journey before them, they
needed no supplies. The cold could not reach them
now, their pitiful feet might be bare. The dead
soldiers, released, fled away eagerly and joined the
long humble file of their fellows.</p>

<p>Chungking stood in the hush that comes when
one’s friends have forsaken one and one’s enemies
have not yet come. Like panels the tall, thin,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
wooden houses lined the steep banks of the river.
Strings of yellow fish and dried vegetables and blue
garments hung across the faces of the houses. The
wall framed the strangely perpendicular city. The
steep steps—Chungking’s only streets—were like
grey gashes or scars down the town. Outside the
wall stood the outcast houses on unsafe trestles; the
feet of the trestles were in the water; the cleanly
dressed outcast women watched the vanquished soldiers
leave the city and waited for the victors to
come in.</p>

<p>The ship was moored opposite Chungking. The
town on this side was diluted with grass and trees.
Green hills, grey hills, blue hills lay behind it.
Groves of sharp thin trees—the cypresses that are
supposed to denote the graves of poets—fitted like
plumed caps upon the lower hills.</p>

<p>Retreating soldiers were climbing the steps on
their thin active ponies. Soldiers were carrying a
few of the wounded along a climbing path. The
wounded were bound to poles.</p>

<p>“Gee, Emily’ll be tickled to death,” said Stone.
“To see us, I mean.”</p>

<p>On shore they asked the only white man they
could see, “Do you know Emily Frere?”</p>

<p>“I ought to,” replied the stranger. “There’s
only about a dozen white women up here. But I
never heard of her. Sure you don’t mean Miss
Erica Blainey?”</p>

<p>Edward covered up in his mind the fact that in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
a community of a dozen women Emily’s name
should be unknown to any sane man. He covered
this fact up as he would have covered up the information
that she wore a wig, had anyone volunteered
it, or that she never took a bath. These were
blasphemies. Erica Blainey flickered through his
mind as an anti-Emily—thin with a pointed quivering
nose and pale lips and very fair corrugated hair.</p>

<p>“Do you know Tam and Lucy McTab?” asked
Stone.</p>

<p>“Now you’re talking,” said the Englishman.
“He’s a celebrity, isn’t he? An author or what
not? He’s borrowed the Worsley bungalow up in
the hills. Want to go? I’ll talk to your chairmen
for you.”</p>

<p>Four men carried each chair. They wore straw
hats like the roofs of round pavilions and blue shirts
and cotton short trousers rolled high above their
knees.</p>

<p>The chairmen chanted intermittently as they
walked; they kept time by means of a sort of retorting
chant, each man speaking rhythmically in turn.
When they wanted to change shoulders they uttered
a series of small screams or jodels. As they bent
their heads under the carrying poles during the
change of shoulders, the chair dipped and canted
alarmingly to one side. Edward each time made
the change as difficult as he could for them. He
shifted his weight; the chair leaned over; there was
a little squall of startled chatter from the balancing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
chairmen. Edward resented the discomfort of the
chair and, since it was bad, determined to make it
worse. He tortured himself by craning out over the
steep edges and watching the shining narrow rice-fields
piercing the feet of the hills. The rice-fields
were banked up below him ingeniously in a stairway
of crescent-shaped dams.</p>

<p>Soldiers were everywhere. In long files they
threaded the narrow mud dikes between the rice-fields.
The steps on the mountain slopes, the tilted
shady villages and the temples were crowded with
them. They wore shabby uniforms of greenish-grey,
red cap-bands, grey frayed puttees apparently wound
about the fleshless bone, and bare angular ankles
showing between the puttees and the straw sandals.
The cobbled climbing street of one village was covered
with a flat roof; every house lacked the wall on
the street side; every house was like a little stage, a
stage set with frightened silent groups watching the
loitering and thronging soldiers. Some shopmen,
with strings of perforated copper money like ornaments
across their shoulders, were trying to conciliate
the soldiers by selling them food. Flour sausages,
coarse biscuits, dumplings, a few “Shao-ping,”
sold at a loss, perhaps meant a daughter saved.
The soldiers were small exhausted men; their jaws
hung with fatigue; their panting mouths looked
square; their knees knocked together. Two of them
had strength enough to beat a country boy with his
own carrying-pole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span></p>

<p>Beside the road, head downward on a flowery
slope, lay a dead man. The splayed yellow soles
of his feet seemed to stare at passers on the
road.</p>

<p>Here were woods in rain, pines with soft tufted
grey needles ... here was a great view of the
winding Yangtze between the wet trunks of trees.
Here were safe and peaceful foreign houses.</p>

<p>And Lucy McTab, stiff and untidy, at the top of
a steep flight of steps.</p>

<p>“Oh, I thought you were Tam coming. How do
you do, Mr. Williams? How do you do, Stone?”</p>

<p>No sound of Emily running along the verandah
to cry, “Edward—Edward—E-yee—E-yee—”
That was her joyful noise. But there was no sound
of it now. Lucy’s voice without that accompaniment
seemed quite meaningless to Edward.</p>

<p>Lucy stood awkwardly patting her hair. She was
not pleased to see Edward and Stone. No plain
statement could have made this more transparently
clear than did her glazed politeness. Edward was
seized with a panic of dumbness; he could not utter
the name of Emily in this nervous, constricted atmosphere.</p>

<p>“Well, so you’ve found your way here,” said
Lucy. “It’s a long way.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I thought your father expected you to wait for
him in Peking, Stone.”</p>

<p>“Yump. I guess he did.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span></p>

<p>“This is a dreadful house to receive visitors in.
Look at the furniture. Tam says it was probably all
bought at the ten cent store. Still, there are advantages
in living here. We can have dogs here for the
first time for years. I do adore dogs. I feel ...
perfect, somehow, if there is a dog in the room.
Sometimes I’m shocked to think how long I spend
looking at the way a dog’s hair grows on his face
... or looking at him crossing his paws in that
patient way. I just look and look.”</p>

<p>There was a dog on the hearth, a handsome
Eurasian dog. Edward crossed the room and looked
blankly down on its golden forehead. One was glad
when one could like anything that Lucy liked, or in
any way flatter her. He noticed that she shrank as
he came near her as though she thought he might
kiss her or insult her.</p>

<p>“These Chinese,” went on Lucy, “are such a weird
unreasonable race. I suppose one will get used to
their funny ways in time. But this fighting is dreadful.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“However, Tam is getting a lot of work done.
He is writing a book about little wars.” Her voice
changed as she spoke of Tam. “It is really a treat
listening to him. I often think what a pity it is that
every word he says just casually to me can’t be preserved.
All about war and politics and ... psychoanalysis
and so on.... He just sits and smokes—he
is an inveterinary smoker—and all these brilliant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
opinions pour out. People would pay to hear them,
I’m sure. Perhaps I am no judge, but I really do
think his book, when it is finished, will be acknowledged
to be one of the most meretricious books of
the century ... you have no idea——”</p>

<p>She checked herself. She had forgotten to be shy
and ladylike, she corrected this oversight.</p>

<p>“Where’s Tam?” asked Stone, whose feelings
seemed to be a reproduction in miniature of Edward’s.</p>

<p>“He’s gone for a walk. He adores rain.”</p>

<p>“Where’s Emerly?” asked Stone.</p>

<p>Lucy was silent for a moment. There was a
sort of clatter in Edward’s mind during her
silence. “Where’s—Emily—where’s—Emily-where’s
Emily,” with the hurried insistence of a telegraphic
tapper. In a second it would be silenced by some
tremendous fact about Emily.</p>

<p>“Emily’s gone.”</p>

<p>Yes, there was silence now in Edward’s mind.</p>

<p>“Whaddyer mean—gone?” asked Stone, ceasing
for a few seconds to chew his gum.</p>

<p>“She left—I think for Shanghai. She didn’t like
it much here. The climate ... the fighting....”</p>

<p>“Did you drive her away?” asked Edward.</p>

<p>Lucy would not answer this. She would not say
anything sincere or even hear anything sincere. She
was afraid of nakedness.</p>

<p>“We were sorry to lose her ... in a way,” she
said, fixing alarmed eyes on Edward. “But her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
health became so bad we could not press her to stay
with us.”</p>

<p>“Did you drive her away?”</p>

<p>There was a bridge of hate between her eyes and
Edward’s.</p>

<p>“Tam valued her services as secretary so much.
He says he can hardly get on without her.”</p>

<p>She would not say anything real. She was like a
martyr, steeped in an ecstasy of pretence, refusing
to recant.</p>

<p>“Well, isn’t this astonishing,” said the exaggerated
voice of Tam. “Wonder upon wonder. First
a mouse eats a hole in my bedroom slippers and then
we are invaded by Californians. All in one day. I
forget your name—” (this to Edward) “—but I
know I love you, as it were. As for you, Stone—ever
find those rainbow pants?”</p>

<p>This was evidently a joke, but Stone did not laugh.</p>

<p>Edward was surprised that he remembered Tam
so well. “I must have thought a great deal about
him without knowing it.” Tam looked excited and
unkempt. He had begun to grow a beard. The
falling lock of hair across his low, nervously wrinkled
forehead gave him a primitive and rather barbarous
look.</p>

<p>“Oh, I know ... I’m always ten minutes late
in an emergency, but I know now. You’re Edward,
the man that Emily talked about.”</p>

<p>“What did she say?” asked Edward huskily.</p>

<p>“She said you were in love with her and wished<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
there were more like you. Are you in love with
her?”</p>

<p>His frankness was an affectation as was Lucy’s
restraint. He had a wide-mouthed, insolent way of
saying these things.</p>

<p>“Where is she now?” asked Edward.</p>

<p>“Oh, I see.” Tam’s voice was deliberately childlike
and naïve. “You’re one of these people who
think it’s immodest to mention love. Well, well,
Stone and I discuss everything we think of, from
God to indigestion, don’t we, old man?” He threw
his arm round the impassive Stone’s neck. “Emily’s
in Shanghai, we believe. Lucy sacked her because
Emily declared her love for me.”</p>

<p>Lucy went quickly out of the room, letting no-one
see her face.</p>

<p>How shocking. How shocking. Emily’s light
defences of brave, witty dignity were torn down so
easily. Emily was humiliated in the sight of the
humiliated Edward.</p>

<p>“Well, well, there’s no accounting for tastes.
There’s no good in refusing to admit these things.
Emily’s a fine, unique creature—too furiously alive
for her own peace of mind. I suppose you don’t
want to stay here now, eh?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Nothing to stay for? You for Shanghai, what?
Well, well, if I didn’t happen to be in love with
Lucy, I’d come too.”</p>

<p>In love with Lucy when Emily loved him? “It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
is because he is a cad,” thought Edward. “Lucy’s
thin love is the kind of love a cad values. Vain men
only live by the love of second-rate women. Emily’s
love doesn’t flatter Tam enough. Her love is too
insolent. She couldn’t cringe. It takes an inglorious
man like me to appreciate glory. It is because I am
so wholly in the dark that I can see the light of
Emily.” Edward tried to imagine Emily’s eager
face, should her love and eagerness be refused. He
thought of her eyes pierced with pain, her brows
drawn together, her cheeks white, the generous expression
of her mouth frozen on pale lips.</p>

<p>“I’ll walk down to the river again with you, if
you like. I want to see some fighting. They say the
Szechaanese may march in at any minute.”</p>

<p>“Say, what did Emerly say about me?” asked
Stone in a muffled voice. This seemed to Edward
an altogether trivial interruption.</p>

<p>“Said you were a bully kid, of course,” said Tam.
He hugged Stone’s shoulders, shook the boy
backwards and forwards and made him look
ridiculous.</p>

<p>“That is the manner of real men with school-boys,”
thought Edward. “If I had adopted that
manner Stone would have loved me.”</p>

<p>“D’you know what happened to me this morning?”
Tam began. “Stone, listen, you’ll roar over
this yarn. When I got out of my bath, I couldn’t
find one of my bedroom slippers. You know the
coldness of the floors of Chinese bathrooms. My<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
little toe is still suffering from infantile paralysis——”</p>

<p>“We must go,” said Edward. “Stone, come.”</p>

<p>Tam’s eyes wore almost the same alarmed expression
that Lucy’s had worn. That expression
apparently meant that Edward was not doing what
was expected of him. He ought to have been looking
eagerly at Tam, waiting with a suspended laugh
on a caught breath for the climax of the story.</p>

<p>“Listen to the yarn,” said Tam with a touch of
asperity. “I hadn’t worn the slippers since my bath
the morning before. I knew I’d left them both by
the bath tub. Their names are Abelard and
Heloïse. Abelard was there, ready for duty, but
Heloïse——”</p>

<p>“We must go.”</p>

<p>“Well, I found her at last. If you’ll believe me,
she was looking into a mouse hole with her tip bitten
off—rape of the Sabines, what? Of course she’s
disfigured for life; my big toe is frankly naked now
when I wear Heloïse, but Abelard still loves her.
You’d expect him to philander now with one of
Lucy’s pumps, but——”</p>

<p>“Come—Stone.”</p>

<p>“I am forced to the conclusion that Edward
doesn’t love me. Most people do, really they do,
Edward. Please enroll yourself with the majority.”
He came over and took both Edward’s reluctant
hands in his. His voice became richer. “Old man,
old man, I know you’re going through hell. Don’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
think I’m unsympathetic and flippant. Listen. I
want to have a long talk with you. I can tell you a
lot of things about Emily that will interest you.
We’ll go down to Chungking together. Nobody
can go on long refusing to be friends with me, can
they, Stone, old man?” He released Edward and
hugged Stone again.</p>

<p>“Aw, let’s go,” said Stone.</p>

<p>As they filed along the verandah a dreadful picture
of the visit came into Edward’s mind. A picture
of two despicable creatures, a dirty gum-chewing
schoolboy and a spotty-faced dentist’s assistant
arriving on a futile and ridiculous errand and
being met and easily dismissed by a competent man
of the world in grey flannel trousers and a tweed
coat—so competent that he was not embarrassed by
a five days’ growth of beard.</p>

<p>Edward wanted to hear the “things about Emily.”
But he wanted still more to hurt and irritate Tam.
So he would not walk down to the river. He sat
sullenly in his chair. The chair-bearers ran down
miles of steep steps with loud triumphant cries. The
chair tilted so acutely forward that Edward had to
cling to its arms. He stared down on to a strange
chart of towns and river. Now and then the chairmen
would put the chair down and wait for Tam
and Stone who were walking. Then, in the distance,
Tam’s voice could be heard coming nearer, saying
something like, “Well, I used to smoke Lucky Strike
in California, but only as a substitute. I have a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
very sensitive palate ...” or, “My finger nails
grow so fast in this damp climate. I have to get
Lucy to cut them. Do you know, Stone, I’d rather
run a mile than cut the nails of my right hand....”</p>

<p>There was no sound from Stone. Sometimes Tam
laughed very loudly—stood in the path and rocked
with laughter—but the joke was apparently not
Stone’s.</p>

<p>“But this is not the way to the ship?” said
Edward to the chairmen as they set him down on
the edge of the river half a mile below the ship.
The four men, not understanding, laughed happily.</p>

<p>Tam and Stone arrived. “I asked. The ship
doesn’t leave till tomorrow morning. You must
come and seek adventures with me in Chungking.
If we’re killed, the English and American governments
will have a glorious time registering protests.
Funny, they don’t seem to care a damn for us until
we die. I loathe diplomats, don’t you? They’re
always too clean for words; they wash eighteen times
a day behind their ears, I believe.”</p>

<p>They were in a sampan crossing obliquely
towards Chungking.</p>

<p>“S’posing we collide with a corpse ...” said
Stone.</p>

<p>“You adorable kid,” said Tam, and the sampan
rocked as he leaned over to pull the boy’s hair.</p>

<p>They collided with no corpses, nor with any of
the sampans, loaded with retreating soldiers, coming
from Chungking. The steps at the foot of which
the sampan landed were moving with soldiers. A
few earthenware jars stood on the lowest step,
abandoned by their owners. On the beach, below<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
the steps, a herd of beggars were raking with their
fingers in a wilderness of refuse. One boy, who had
committed some breach of muck-raking etiquette,
was being held down by two women; his legs were
being stretched by another boy and the taut muscles
pounded by yet another avenger. His screams followed
the travellers as they climbed the steps.
There was a half open arched gate through the city
wall at the top of the steps. The town within the
wall was so silent that, for a long time, they could
hear the screams of the beggar boy on the mud
shore.</p>

<p>Many of the booths and the shops were shut.
Shopmen with black caps and long gowns stood expectantly
outside their barred doors. Tense faces
looked from the leaning upper windows into the
abyss of the narrow street. A closely curtained
light chair was carried swiftly by, and a young Chinese
woman with a frightened face pushed aside the
curtains and looked out when she heard the booted
tread of the three foreigners. Perhaps she hoped
they were wild wicked soldiers and would see her.
The houses leaned together, propped up by their
own crooked shadows; a fringe of gilded shop signs
swayed so low that the occasional cavalrymen had
to dismount and lead their horses. Soldiers passed,
all facing towards the river gate. The soldiers
swaggered by the dubious, watching citizens. The
soldiers looked afraid, but their mouths opened to
shout confident things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span></p>

<p>“Buy nice ivory?” said one of the shopkeepers to
Tam in a soft voice. The shopkeeper clasped his
hands and bowed himself slightly towards Tam.
Stone was sitting on the rough counter of a deserted
booth watching the soldiers. Tam and Edward left
him in the street and entered the shop when the
shopman had taken down one shutter.</p>

<p>“This feller knows me,” said Tam. “It was here
I finally found the cigarette-holder that Emily
wanted.”</p>

<p>The shopman brought down various and unlikely
things for their inspection, an opium pipe, a large
porcelain figure, a curly animal made of dull jade
the color of a shallow sea, a polished screen of
blackwood. Tam fingered the porcelain figure as he
talked.</p>

<p>“I promised you I’d tell you various things about
Emily. I met her first about three years ago, soon
after I had married Lucy. She and I met Emily at
a theatre party.... I am a wholehearted man and
an obstinate man; at the play I was irritated because
Emily seemed so conscious of her own cleverness.
I didn’t want to be forced to be conscious
of her. I find Lucy adorable because I am never
conscious of her—she is like air to me. I am clever
myself and I refuse to be distracted. Emily has
once or twice very nearly succeeded in distracting
me—against my will. I have been hardened against
her, simply because she tried so hard. I like awfully
being with her. With her I can be much wittier than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
without her. With her nothing ever falls flat. And
Lucy was fond of her too; Lucy insisted on my
bringing Emily round the world as my secretary.
When that was arranged, Emily said to Lucy, ‘How
d’you know I won’t steal Tam? What would you
call that, Lucy—committing astigamy?’ It shocked
Lucy. Lucy’s mind wears tight stays, you know.
That fact makes things easier for me. She never
disconcerts me. On the other hand she is often disconcerted
by me. Emily never is. To me, after
that sally, Emily said—‘How d’you know I don’t
love you? What would you call that?’ Somehow
Emily ... never paid back the loan of life. Emily
never let me forget her. She could not believe that
I could continue not to love her. If she had not
been so clever I might have loved her. She put her
wits between herself and me—a shining armor. She
did most fatally watch me, and if there was an increased
softness or success between us at any time—her
eyes seemed to seize that moment and devour it,
so that the moment, for me, was gone. She knows
herself and everything that is happening to her too
well.”</p>

<p>His fingers seemed trying to knead the china
figure in front of him. The shopman’s assistant had
placed two bowls of tea before them.</p>

<p>Something had been heard outside. Edward had
not heard it. Everyone was moving. The assistant
ran two stout horizontal bars across the shutters.
He had not time to put up the missing shutter. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
was driven indoors by the sound of running feet
down the street. Even Edward could hear that
sound. A strange voiceless whispering of many
bare feet. Men and children ran by, all in one
crowd, arms bent, mouths open, distorted, breathless
faces. They made no sound except with their running
whispering feet. The assistant lifted the porcelain
figure as one lifts a baby and crouched behind
the counter with it. The shopman stood with his
eye to a crack in the shutter. Edward and Tam
sat on two blackwood stools at the foot, as it were,
of a ghost, a blue and green and gold mandarin coat
crucified on a screen.</p>

<p>There was no sound anywhere.</p>

<p>Then there was a faint shuffling. Two soldiers
came uncertainly down the street. Their uniform
was new to Edward, a mustard-yellow one. They
carried their rifles alertly, pointing forward. They
walked with a crouching gait. Their faces looked
dark and drunken.</p>

<p>There was another silence. Then a hum of muttering
voices rose from behind closed shutters.</p>

<p>“Well, well, better go while the going’s good,”
said Tam in a prosaic voice. “Where’s Stone, I
wonder?”</p>

<p>The shopman made pacifying gestures and tapped
his ear. There was a very distant sound of rifle fire.</p>

<p>Edward and Tam leaned back against the broad
coat. “Better wait here a bit. D’you want me to
go on about Emily?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span></p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether you’d want me to tell you
that I have been Emily’s lover. Once. Champagne
makes her blessedly silly and uncaring ... she sits
smiling like a baby then ... she is serene at last.
I adore people who are tranquil, who don’t compete
... Emily, gentle, is absolutely perfect. Lucy
is always gentle but she is not perfect. She is not—Emily.
Well, I suppose I ought to say Emily—plus
champagne. You see I tell you this to show that I
am not trying to make the best of myself. It became,
I suppose, harder for Emily after that. She
was bad-tempered often, dull often, after that.
Once she cried in public and she talked sometimes
pathetically about herself to me—a thing I can’t
stand. I am not interested in pathos. I am not
interested, I may say, in people from their own point
of view, especially women. I don’t see pathos in
myself, why should pathos be expected to appeal
to me?”</p>

<p>“We ought to go,” said Edward. He had seen
a picture of Emily crying, Emily with red staring
eyes full of tears, crying, behind a wet handkerchief,
to find words that might effectively array her grief
before a man who was “not interested in pathos.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go,” said Tam. “I wonder where Stone
is. Excellent person, Stone, what? Always falls
on his feet.”</p>

<p>They walked down the deserted street. The city
gate to which they first came was shut and within its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
arch on the inner side was a group of soldiers of
the retreating army. Stone Ponting was leaning
against the shoulder of one of the more passive
soldiers, watching the others. Stone was spitting,
preparatory to inserting a new piece of gum. The
soldiers seemed too busy arguing to resent Stone’s
close inspection.</p>

<p>“Bum soldiers, I’ll say,” said Stone when he saw
Tam. “I’d like to see our doughboys act this way.
Say listen, I saw a guy chasing off with a sack of
silver and—by golly—it split. Gee, there was iron
men all over the sidewalk and he didn’t stop to pick
many ofum up. The soldiers did that forum. They
should worry. What gets me’s that I came up too
late.”</p>

<p>The argument among the soldiers ceased suddenly
as the gate was half opened. They filed through one
by one. “Look as much like Chinese infantry as
you can and we’ll go with ’em,” whispered Tam.
They all three passed out among the soldiers and
the man in charge of the gate did not challenge
them.</p>

<p>The mud beach between the city wall and the
river was crowded with soldiers; by sheer force of
numbers they were shouldering the beggars and the
outcast women out of their heritage. They had one
common desire—to get away. Every boat that
could be commandeered was over-filled with soldiers
the moment it could be brought to the beach. Each
boat pushed away bristling like a porcupine with upright<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
figures and with bayonets. As the current
caught the boats and swung them down the river,
desultory shouts came from a distant bank upstream.</p>

<p>“Well, well,” said Tam. “It looks as if we shall
have to wait till the end of the war to get across the
river. I wish I could talk Chinese and then I would
ask one of these soldiers what it feels like to be so
much afraid. Do you know, it may sound vain, but
I don’t know what fear is. I’ll tell you a yarn——”</p>

<p>“We can get on board that boat,” said Edward.</p>

<p>Some unexplained argument among the thronging
soldiers was keeping half empty a boat which had
just been brought to shore. Tam, with his arrogant
Englishman’s manner, pushed the soldiers apart and
led his companions into the boat.</p>

<p>“Sailee acrossee, what?” he said in a bright
charming voice to the nearest oarsman. Whenever
Tam used that voice he obviously expected every
face to light up with tolerance and smiles. He was
accustomed to this result. His charm failed to work
now. For the Chinese, boat space meant life and
the lack of it death. A loud noise of protest arose
from all the soldiers within earshot. Angry hands
sawed the air in the direction of the three intruders.
Hands pushed their shoulders. No-one was smiling.</p>

<p>Edward jumped quickly ashore again. He had
an exaggerated terror of finding himself unwelcome.</p>

<p>“Hey, hey....” shouted Tam, for once losing
his confidence. “Come back, Edward. This is an
outrage. You blithering fools. Have got muchee<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
money, what? Two piecee dollar per headee ...
three dollar ... four dollar ... what you likee,
blast your eyes....”</p>

<p>He and Stone were pushed on shore again. They
were ankle-deep in soft mud. The boat filled with
soldiers and was pushed off. Tam was furious. He
had been made ridiculous. They sat in a sombre
row on the steps. There was a long silence. They
watched the boat that had refused them make its
difficult way across the river. They were all half
conscious of the hope that it might be hit by a stray
bullet or two, that they might be avenged. But all
the shots went wide. White upright needles of
water showed where the shots fell, far short of the
path of the crossing boats.</p>

<p>“Emily did come here, though, didn’t she?” said
Edward in a strained voice.</p>

<p>Tam’s face brightened. This story ministered to
his vanity. He was enjoying the telling of it.</p>

<p>“Why, of course she did. She was a wonderful
secretary. If she’d wanted to go, I wouldn’t have
allowed it. She didn’t want to. All the way up the
river she kept up these curious fantastic moods. She
would say the most extravagantly affectionate and
admiring things about Lucy. She talked—curiously
enough—a great deal about you, Edward. You
don’t mind my saying that she laughed at you a lot.
When Emily is malicious she is very amusing. That
side of her cleverness doesn’t annoy me; that form
of her humor is a sort of complement to my humor—which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
is essentially unmalicious. I love everyone.
I really do. I love loving—so I love. So she
and I don’t collide there, as it were. However, it
evidently relieved and pleased her to think and talk
a good deal of you. She had a devil’s manner to
me; it was hardly bearable sometimes. She never
missed an opportunity of slighting me. She put on a
sort of disguise of sneering humility. She would
offer to go away if she were sitting with Lucy and I
came up.”</p>

<p>Poor Emily. Edward knew so terribly well these
heartbreaking defiances of the mind. She had
sneered at him—Edward. Perhaps it had really relieved
her to hide herself in sneers. Self-torturer
though he was, he could not conceive that she would
really sneer at him with her heart. He thought he
could face this possibility but actually he vaguely
imagined witty and gratifying criticism of his modesty
and his intensity. He only imagined mockery
from her that he could have borne to hear. He
thought, “Our selfless hero is willing to be sacrificed
on the altar of her pain.”</p>

<p>Tam was saying, “Yes, of course she came here.
She was here for three days.”</p>

<p>There was another uproar among the soldiers on
the beach.</p>

<p>“Gee, there’s some white men in trouble,” said
Stone. He jumped to his feet and hurried towards
the scene of the trouble. Two Englishmen in a
motor-boat were holding themselves several yards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
from the shore. Their intention was to pick up a
third Englishman who was waiting on the beach.
But the intention of about fifty Chinese soldiers evidently
was to board the boat as soon as it touched
the shore. Everyone was angry. Tam and Edward
and Stone joined the marooned Englishman on land.
This re-inforcement rather disconcerted the soldiers.
The motor boat drew in. Tam, Edward, Stone and
the stranger flew into the air at the same second.
There they were, safe in the boat. Edward had
slightly sprained his ankle. A Chinese soldier was
unfortunately found to be safe in the boat too.</p>

<p>“Push him over,” said the steersman in a savage
voice.</p>

<p>“Oh, let him stay,” said Tam, laying his hand on
the nervous soldier’s knee. “He’s equalled my long-jump
record. He deserves to be preserved.”</p>

<p>Everyone except Edward smiled and felt kindly
towards Tam and the intrusive soldier. The boat
made a noise like a mammoth typewriter and faced
upstream.</p>

<p>Their laborious and slanting course brought them
finally to the opposite bank near to the point at
which the Ichang steamer was moored.</p>

<p>“I’ll come on board and have a drink with you,”
said Tam. “No need for us to part until we
must.”</p>

<p>Whiskies and sodas stood like a bond between
them. Stone wished he could really enjoy the taste
of whisky. He hummed a little as though he were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
enjoying it, but he took his glass forward to empty
it secretly into the Yangtze.</p>

<p>Tam and Edward stood against the railing of the
steamer and watched the escaping soldiers land.
The soldiers on this side seemed not very much disturbed
by the fact that the advancing army was now
in the city of Chungking and was firing from the
walls upon the river. The fugitives on this side
could not have been disturbed any more by anything.
They were exhausted; they crept up the slopes
limply, trailing their rifles in the mud; their mouths
were open, their sunken eyes apparently shut; they
made little whining sounds. Some of them lay resting,
as flaccid as dead worms. A few had energy
enough to impress the citizens of the town into their
service. The sight of arms seemed to enchant the
civilians. A long line of coolies, collected by soldiers,
stood roped together in a slanting row up the
steps, like cattle. Upon their sullen yet unprotesting
shoulders would be placed the burdens which the
soldiers themselves were too weak to carry.</p>

<p>Edward watched one soldier blindly seeking a
human animal on which to place his pack. A child
could have knocked that soldier down. He was thin
and immature; he could pretend to be a man no
longer; his shoulders drooped forward, his hanging
head swayed between them; his eyes seemed shut; he
dragged his rifle in the mud; he walked awry like a
drunken man. Six big boatmen saw him coming
towards them. He followed them as a senseless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
ghost or curse might follow, slowly and sightlessly.
He followed them on to a moored junk and from
that on to another. On the last junk in the line he
came up to them. They would not fight; they could
retreat no further. Still without seeming to see them
he selected one. That one did not protest; he was
driven away to be roped to the end of the growing
line of cattle-prisoners on the steps.</p>

<p>“They’ll never come back, those men,” said Tam.
“The soldiers shoot ’em when they’re through with
’em. Poor devils.”</p>

<p>He said “poor devils” in an intense tremulous
voice, as though he were really sorry for the afflicted
townsmen. Edward imagined him saying to himself,
“I’m a tender-hearted chap, a man of wide
sympathies. I must make that quite clear.”</p>

<p>“People never undeceive self-deceivers,” thought
Edward. “We all conspire to pretend we are deceived.”</p>

<p>Tam took Edward’s arm with a roughly loving
flourish and said in a brisk voice, as though brushing
from his mind’s eye an unmanly tear—which he was
nevertheless proud of—“A heart-breaking sight,
old man, let’s sit on the other side of the deck.”</p>

<p>They did so. The sharp needles that denoted
rifle fire from the other side were being injected into
the shining body of the river. But though even
Edward could sometimes hear the mewing twang of
shots in the air, it was obvious that the marksmen
were giving the foreign ship a fairly wide berth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll go on about Emily,” said Tam in a rather
luxurious voice. “It’s an unhappy yarn for me to
tell, of course, but you have a right to hear it. Lucy
turned her out of our house. We had been here
three days. Lucy is ... rather dumb in this story,
if you know what I mean. Lucy has always escaped
storms. She thinks emotions are indecent—any
kind, I mean, and any degree. But especially misery
or ecstasy. If you said to Lucy, ‘I believe in God,’
outside of a church, she would think you were irreverent.
If you said, ‘I love you better than my life,’
outside of a decorous marriage or recognised flirtation,
she would think you improper. All along you
could see that she was hiding the situation from herself.
But, I suppose unconsciously, she developed a
habit of being obviously proud of me in Emily’s
presence. She had a way of looking round when I
said anything clever, as if saying, ‘Look what he can
do—and he’s mine.’ Several times Emily, who
never hides anything from anyone, least of all herself,
commented with a sort of swagger on this trick
of Lucy’s. Once she said, ‘Lucy, you look as if
you’d helped the Lord to create him.’ ‘Mother
Lucy’s chicken,’ she called me once or twice. But
one night at that bungalow it was fearfully hot——”</p>

<p>At that bungalow! Emily’s sure clear presence
had really parted the pine-shadowed air of that
garden. The sound of Emily’s steps clicking up
those steps had really travelled on this warm damp
wind to an unquickened hearing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span></p>

<p>“Lucy put her hand on my arm and said in her
tolerant and reproachful way, ‘My darling’—like
that, ‘My darling’—as a check to some flippant profanity
I had just indulged in. And Emily stood up
and—you know her way, even in small things—jumped
with her heels on the floor. She clutched
her clenched hands to her breasts and drew the
corners of her mouth down and shouted, ‘Not your
darling—not your darling—not your darling—’
many times. It seemed as if she would never stop.
My God, we were all perspiring—we were so sick
with heat and with disgust, somehow, even I, who am
not afraid of emotions. Emily came and beat with
her hands upon my chest. ‘Oh, Tam’—she cried,
‘Oh, Tam—save me....’ Then you could see that
Lucy had been expecting something of the sort all
along—she was so quick. Lucy had her. Lucy had
her fast by the shoulders. Lucy pushed her in a
sort of fussy, curious, shocked way out of the room.
Lucy was dark red and she was making a sort of
stammering blubbering little voiceless sound between
her lips like someone shooing away a hen. ‘Now
you can go right away at once....’ I could hear
Lucy saying in a loud trembling voice in the next
room. I could hear the shuffle of Emily’s things
being thrown into the suitcase.”</p>

<p>Emily’s things! There was something unbearably
poignant to Edward in that. That delicate
fawn-colored silk dress that had held her body, the
beads from her neck, the shoes from her dancing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
feet ... all Emily’s things outraged, not wanted,
the things she had chosen to be part of her presence—despised.</p>

<p>“Lucy worked absurdly hard. She insisted on
carrying the suitcases out on to the verandah; she
made her insistence somehow insulting. She pulled
Emily’s arm as they went to the verandah, as though
to make it clear that this was a forcible ejection.
Well, there was nothing for it. I fetched the chair-coolies.
There was nothing to be done. Emily
seemed to be beyond help—she was beyond her own
control; she was crying so violently, crying with a
sort of grin, a downward grin, in the violent way a
child cries....”</p>

<p>And now Edward was crying. He had his head
upon his arms on the railing. He was crying without
pretence. There was a whirlpool of helpless
fury in his heart. To cry was all that he could do—because
Emily had been made to cry so terribly.</p>

<p>“Well, well, it’s a hysterical yarn altogether,”
said Tam. He laid his hand on the back of
Edward’s neck. The touch was meant to be sympathetically
manly, but his fingers seemed to pinch
Edward’s neck almost spitefully.</p>

<p>“You poor thing ... Edward ... You’re a
poor thing. You poor things can never be happy.
Sorrow gravitates to people like you. You—poor—thing....”</p>

<p>Edward thought of Emily waiting for him at
Shanghai. He had her address from Tam. He had
telegraphed to her. But surely she would know,
even without telegrams, that he was coming now.</p>

<p>It was a dingy hotel in Shanghai. It had brown
pillars painted to resemble marble. The resemblance
was as faint as was that of the paper objects
on the mantelpiece to flowers.</p>

<p>Edward waited and waited. He had not told
Stone where he was going. Stone had gone to a
movie. Edward hoped that he would never see him
again. Edward still had most of Stone’s remaining
money in his suitcase. Somehow if he never saw
Stone again Edward felt that the money would not
matter. If one were never reminded one need not
remember. A crime of which one was never accused
was no crime. Edward had no self-accuser on the
subject of money. There were limits to his humility
and to his humiliation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span></p>

<p>Edward waited and waited.</p>

<p>Even when Emily came he found himself still
waiting. For she came with a group of people.</p>

<p>Edward felt sick. His lips and his hands trembled.
Emily did not look so incredible as he had
expected. She looked quite human. He thought it
was amazing that he should recognise her. How
did he know she really was Emily? She was hidden
in a crowd of foolish people. She was disguised by
a calm rather stiff smile and faint blue shadows
under her still eyes. Her body, usually nervous with
life and mockery, moved staidly.</p>

<p>“Well, Edward ... I got your wire. I have
been dreadfully excited since I got it. You darling,
funny old Edward.... Now you must know all
these nice people ... Mrs. Thompson, Mrs. Hoskins,
Mr. Thompson, Captain Ross ... this is
Edward Williams.”</p>

<p>How little her voice was. She had probably worn
it away by crying.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it funny—I knew Mrs. Thompson when I
first came out in India and she and I have been spinning
round and round the world ever since without
colliding—till now. They are all on their way back
to India from here—much too soon for me....”</p>

<p>That accounted for them. They lived in India.
They were all accustomed to supporting British
prestige.</p>

<p>Mrs. Thompson and Mrs. Hoskins looked bright
for a moment, noticing that Edward was a man.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
Their faces fell when they saw what a poor man he
was, but they did not become spiteful as they would
have, had he been a woman. Mrs. Thompson
cringed intensely as she shook Edward’s hand; she
peered with rigid sweetness into his eyes. The
manner was automatic with her when a man was
introduced. The hair of Mrs. Hoskins was brightly
dyed and she had apparently been crushing cinders
upon her eyelashes. So she did not trouble to don
a laborious charm of manner; she relied upon her
outside enchantments. Mr. Thompson was faded
and supercilious; his withered tired face was set at
an angle that directed his eyes far above anyone’s
head. Captain Ross’ collar seemed too tight for him
and his tiny moustache quivered as if he were not
quite sure whether people really appreciated his importance.</p>

<p>Edward had been brought up as a child in India.
All his mother’s friends had been of this type—at
least the husbands had been his mother’s friends, the
wives her enemies, this division being the basis of
society in India.</p>

<p>A terrible thing was happening. Everyone was
going away except Mrs. Thompson.</p>

<p>“Back soon, Edward,” said Emily. “I must take
Toby Ross to the map and make him admit that
New York is further west than Valparaiso.”</p>

<p>Two by two they went into another room, Emily
and Captain Ross, Mrs. Hoskins and Mr. Thompson.
Mrs. Thompson was unable to move since she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
could not, of course, cross the room unescorted by a
man. She sat down tenderly beside Edward.</p>

<p>“It is <em>so</em> hot ...” she leaned forward with her
face near his. The heat, he gathered, was a secret
between him and her. “It is <em>so</em> hard on me to come
into this heat. I suffer <em>so</em> from heat.”</p>

<p>“Emily looks thinner too,” said Edward. He felt
ashamed because a face that was not Emily’s was so
close to his.</p>

<p>Mrs. Thompson looked aggrieved. “No, but it
is <em>particularly</em> difficult for me. People don’t seem to
understand how acutely I suffer in this damp heat.
I have had bronchitis <em>twice</em> in the last year. My
husband is in <em>despair</em>.”</p>

<p>“She expects me to love her the more for her
bronchitis,” thought Edward. He sat and perspired.
“Why live in India, then?” it occurred to
him presently to say fretfully. “Why live at all?”
he might have said.</p>

<p>“My <em>whole life</em> is bound up in India. My <em>dearest</em>
friends—you don’t happen to know J. L. Wilkinson
of the Tea Commission, do you? Funny, I get on <em>so</em>
much better with men than with women.... In
India we know how to live and enjoy life....
One’s servants <em>adore</em> one—look how difficult the
labor problem is in England—We had a house in
St. Leonards when we were on leave.... I had to
open the front door myself. I often thought how
<em>horrified</em> my friends in India would have been ...
a fragile person like me....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span></p>

<p>Here was Emily coming, leading the procession.
“I was right. Toby was wrong.”</p>

<p>Captain Ross raised one eyebrow. The skin of
his face looked so tight that one wondered how his
eyebrow found leeway. Certainly he could not have
moved both at once.</p>

<p>“Most ex-straw-dinary thing,” he said in a suffocated
voice.</p>

<p>“Sure you won’t come to the Merriment for dinner,
Emily?” asked Mr. Thompson. The faces of
Mrs. Hoskins and Mrs. Thompson showed this
plainly to be a man-like idiocy. It would have been
impossible for either of them to tolerate a party at
which there should be one woman too many.</p>

<p>“I’m dining with Edward tonight,” said Emily.
“Another time, please, I’d love to.”</p>

<p>They were gone.</p>

<p>“Come up to my room,” said Emily.</p>

<p>Directly the door of her room was shut behind
them, Emily’s face began to twitch. Her eyes
looked twice as large as they had been; it was because
they were full of tears.</p>

<p>“Oh, Edward,” she cried, running to him, “you
have heard. You have heard. Isn’t this a terrible
thing? Everything has been terrible that has happened
to me. Edward ... I can’t ever stop crying.
My eyes are tired of holding tears in....”</p>

<p>Edward had her at last in his arms. He sat on
her bed and held her on his knee. She was rigid.
She would not be comfortable. She pressed her face<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
into his shoulder but her body was stiff and uncomforted.
She cried, “Edward ... Edward ...
Edward ... such a terrible thing....” Her
crying sounded fantastically like laughter. She cried
in a little weak downward scale, a little A-ha-ha-ha-ha
... and Oh Edward—with each upward
breath.</p>

<p>Edward was trembling violently. He was racked
with disgust because of his own dumbness. He
stroked her hair with his shaking hand. He stroked
the back of her neck, her twitching shoulder. He
put his lips to her hair. She was murmuring something,
but her mouth was against his shoulder. What
was she saying? He was cursed. His ears shut
from him small epoch-making sounds.</p>

<p>“Emily, what are you saying? Lift up your
head.... I can’t hear.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you can’t hear, you can’t hear. Nobody
can save me.”</p>

<p>She slipped her shoulder from under his hand.
She stood up. “There is no comfort anywhere for
me,” she said. She looked out of the window. She
was more quiet but often her long upward breaths
were sobs. “Go away, Edward. I can’t dine anywhere
with you. With people looking on. I can’t
stop crying any more.”</p>

<p>The time for touching her was perhaps over, but
he stood beside her at the window and took her indifferent
hand. “I can’t go away. I can’t leave you
alone.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span></p>

<p>“I can never be alone. That’s the dreadful part.
I can’t get away from myself. I am horrible to
myself.”</p>

<p>“You are perfect to me.”</p>

<p>Her hand in his trembled a little. What did she
say? She spoke in such a shaking small voice.</p>

<p>“Yes ... after all my lovely life ... I am
loved by you.”</p>

<p>Could she have said that?</p>

<p>There was a long silence but they were standing
hand in hand all the time.</p>

<p>“I will order dinner to be sent up here,” said
Edward.</p>

<p>“The waiter would see me crying. People would
talk if I dined with a man in my bedroom.”</p>

<p>“Listen, Emily, lie down. I will go out and buy
... strawberries and cream ... and asparagus
... and cheese straws ... and champagne ...
the most perfect things to eat and drink in the
world. Couldn’t you laugh again, sitting picnicking
cross-legged on the floor ... as we sat in the California
forests?”</p>

<p>She gave a loud broken cry and threw up her
hands.</p>

<p>“Oh, Tam ... Tam ... Tam ...”</p>

<p>“Lie down, Emily.”</p>

<p>“Tam ... Tam ... Tam ...”</p>

<p>“Lie down, Emily.”</p>

<p>She lay face downwards on her bed. He noticed
that her face fitted into a depression in the pillow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
that was already there. So she had already spent
hours in that attitude.</p>

<p>She was still in that attitude when he came in—laden.
A laden Chinese from the shop was behind
him outside the door. Edward had bought thin
Chinese plates patterned with green dragons; he had
bought two gold-colored Venetian glasses for the
champagne. He had not even forgotten a corkscrew.
He spread supper on a fine Swatow table-cloth
on the floor. Emily took no notice. Edward
thought, “Is this silly or is it just right—to have
supper on the floor? Would another man have done
it differently—bought a table or something?”</p>

<p>He touched Emily’s hair.</p>

<p>“Look ... darling little Emily.”</p>

<p>She was not crying when she lifted her face. She
got up and put her arms round his neck. “Charming
Edward, gentle, comforting, funny, Edward.”</p>

<p>His name sounded exquisite like that.</p>

<p>When she had drunk a glass of champagne her
eyes were quite dry. Neither she nor Edward spoke
for a long time. Emily ate a little of everything
that he had bought. But she would not keep pace
with him in drinking champagne. Now he was sure
he would hear everything she said; she might say
some tiny perfect thing that would otherwise have
escaped him. But all she said was, “Toby Ross
wants me to marry him.”</p>

<p>“Sensible feller,” said Edward. He was careful
to be very calm, but secretly he was rigid with anger<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
against Ross. Edward hoped that Ross was capable
of feeling the pain that he deserved.</p>

<p>“I suppose that would seem to you the last degradation.
To become a memsahib. To paint one’s
face and talk malevolently about ‘people not quite
of our class.’ To play bridge very well and have
‘absolutely <em>no</em> time to read, my dear.’ To spend all
one’s energies on scoring off other women. It would
certainly be a ... flat end to all high adventurousness.
I met Toby in India—it seems a hundred
years ago, really six years ago. (Was I alive six
years ago? I wonder how I used my thoughts up—six
years ago.) What do you think of Toby,
Edward? Somehow I can’t compare him with
other people. He hates highbrows. He is even a
little ashamed of reading Charles Lever. When he
says something that is not so stupid, I think proudly
‘that’s darn good for Toby.’... I don’t know
why I feel like that. About nine out of ten things
he says prove that he has missed the whole point;
the tenth thing, well, perhaps I put the cleverness into
it myself ... kind of defensively ... anyway I
pretend to myself that it is a tiny bit clever. I have
been so much ... afraid of Tam all these three
years that I thought a great deal about Toby ...
and about you, Edward, lately. A sort of safety. I
thought, ‘Well, even if he despises me, Toby and
Edward don’t ... and sometimes they are perhaps
a little bit wonderful too.’ I often think of something
you said about Elijah’s cloak dropped by mistake<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
from the flaming aeroplane and then I think,
‘Why ... why, Tam, there’s a waiting list of clever
men for me.’ If you are despised you build walls
round the last little stronghold of your vanity.
Mine were weak walls. They fell down altogether
at Chungking. I don’t know why things have happened
to me this way. I’m the sort of person,
Edward, who is always said to be charming—by
people who don’t love me. Elderly men and kind
women seem to think I’m everywhere beloved. Perhaps
I swagger a bit ... not in so many words, of
course. One thing I can never swagger about, the
only perfect thing in my life ... that the most
darling and wonderful man in the world ... loved
me for an hour or two....”</p>

<p>After a pause she said, “I suppose Tam is right.
I am too conscious, too watchful of what is happening
to me.”</p>

<p>And then presently, “But you do love me—Edward,
say quickly—you do love me, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“I’m a very dumb person,” said Edward. “It is
great pain to me to be so ... shut away from the
hope of really telling you how much I love you.
Emily, would you—but, please, you must—you must
marry me tomorrow?”</p>

<p>What was she saying? Her head was on his
shoulder. She spoke softly but now he could hear.
He was listening and planning just as though he
were a real man—not Edward. Adequate at last.</p>

<p>“If you leave me alone,” she said, “I shall never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
stop crying. Can’t we go to some happier place?
This minute? Edward, don’t leave me alone for a
minute here.”</p>

<p>He would never leave her alone again. Everything
was perfectly easy at last. He had money.
Stone’s money. Nothing could be more easy or
fortunate.</p>

<p>“<em>But she is pretending I am Tam.</em> Never mind,
I can pretend too. I have always been good at
pretending. I can pretend that she wants me at
last.”</p>

<p>From minute to minute he could pretend. Not
for longer. It was very dangerous. He would not
face the coming minute. He could not hold the
frenzied minutes. They were mad. They were
frantic, thundering towards the fearful edge of the
world.</p>

<p>Was this the happier place she had spoken of?
It was the “best suite” in the happier hotel. There
were Emily’s two suitcases on the floor. One was
leaning against Edward’s suitcase. The room was
panelled in pale blue. This was only the sitting-room.
The bedroom opened from it.</p>

<p>Time was doing its best. One minute gave him
Emily’s—“Oh, Edward, darling ... isn’t it all
lovely....” Another—“Let me look at you,
Edward, at least you have nice heavy eyes. What
would happen if you opened your eyes wide?”</p>

<p>Then she pushed him angrily. She put her two
thin, cruel hands upon his chest. She was crying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
again. “Go away ... go away. You are nothing....
Oh, Tam ... Tam....”</p>

<p>She had gone into the inner room and locked the
door.</p>

<p>He was nothing. She was right. He could see
himself now, sagging, disordered, his forehead
against her locked door. She was speaking. What
was she saying? Was she saying, “Wait, Edward,
wait only a little minute ... darling Edward, I
love you ... at last.”</p>

<p>No, he could not hear what she was saying. He
was on his knees to her locked door. “Emily ...
Emily....”</p>

<p>She would not answer.</p>

<p>Yes, she answered. She opened the door. She
ran past him into the middle of the outer room.
She turned and faced him.... Her cheeks were
very red and her eyes excited.</p>

<p>“Leave me alone,” she shouted harshly and hideously.
“Can’t you leave me alone? I can’t bear you.
I couldn’t bear to touch you—you poor sickly
thing....”</p>

<p>That was nothing. What she had said was nothing.
Silence had covered it up now. If he could
put his arms about her again....</p>

<p>She hit him on the face. She hit him again and
again.</p>

<p>She was crying again. She would not let him
reach a rock of silence in this wild sea in which he
was drowning. She was crying loudly. And whose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
voice was that, beseeching against her crying?
“Emily ... Emily ... Emily....” Was it his
own voice?</p>

<p>“You must believe it now,” she sobbed. “You—poor—thing....”</p>

<p>She was gone. The seas were still. A desert ...
a continent of silence....</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
